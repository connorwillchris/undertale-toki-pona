   Ribbit, ribbit. I have heard you are quite  merciful, for a human... 
  \W Surely you know by now a  monster wears a \YYELLOW\W name  when you can \YSPARE\W it. 
   What do you think of that?         Very        It's         Helpful     Bad 
    
   It is rather helpful. Remember, sparing is just  saying you won't fight. 
   Maybe one day, you'll  have to do it even if  their name isn't yellow. 
   Really? Then, I'll tell all  of my friends to tell  their friends' friends... 
   Never use yellow names. How about that? 
           Keep        No more         Yellow      Yellow         Names       Names 
    
   OK, they will still  use yellow names. 
   OK, I will let them  know not to use yellow  names. 
   Ribbit, ribbit. How are you doing without  yellow names? 
                       Bring          It's        Them         great       Back 
    
   Glad to hear it. Though, I do not know why  you dislike yellow. 
   You had better hope you do  not encounter a banana-themed  monster. 
   Huh? It's rather inconvenient  that you changed your mind  like this. 
   Since I told everyone  not to use yellow names,  everyone threw theirs out. 
   This is really troubling... Hmmm... 
  \W Well, last year it was  fashionable to have \ppink\W   names. 
   I think everyone still  has those in their closets  somewhere... 
   I'll ask everyone to look. But this is the last time! 
   Ribbit, ribbit... I hope you're satisfied.

   Anything you want to  do is important  enough.

   Do what you have to. 
   Tra la la. I am the riverman. 
   Or am I the riverwoman...? It doesn't really matter. 
   I love to ride in my boat. Would you care to join me? 
   Ride in the boat?          Yes         No

   Seems like a comfortable  bed. 
   Lie on it?          Yes         No 
    
    
   It's just a regular suspicious  bed now. 
   It's a yellow key. You put it on your  keychain. 
   There's something under  the sheets. 
   Check it out?          Yes         No

  \E7 I always was a crybaby,  wasn't I, \[C]?

   ... 
  \E5  + '' + Frisk? + '' +  
  \E7 That's... 
  \E5 A nice name. 
   ... 
  \E7 Frisk... 
   I haven't felt like  this for a long time. 
   As a flower, I was  soulless. 
   I lacked the power to  love other people. 
   However, with everyone's  souls inside me... 
  \E7 I not only have my own  compassion back... 
  \E5 But I can feel every  other monster's as  well. 
  \E7 They all care about  each other so much. 
   And... they care about  you too, Frisk. 
   ... 
  \E7 I wish I could tell  you how everyone  feels about you. 
   Papyrus... Sans... Undyne... Alphys... 
   ... Toriel. 
  \E7 Monsters are weird. 
  \E5 Even though they barely  know you... 
  \E6 It feels like they  all really love  you. 
  \E8 Haha. 
   ... 
   Frisk... I... I understand if you  can't forgive me. 
   I understand if you  hate me. 
   I acted so strange and  horrible. 
  \E3 I hurt you. 
   I hurt so many people. 
   Friends, family,  bystanders... 
  \E3 There's no excuse for  what I've done. 
      Forgive     Do not 
    
  \E3 Wh... what? 
  \E7 ... Frisk, come on. 
   You're... You're gonna make me  cry again. 
  \E7 ... besides, even if  you do forgive me... 
   ... right. 
   I understand. 
   I just hope that... 
   I can make up for  it a little right  now. 
   I can't keep these  souls inside of me. 
   The least I can do  is return them. 
   But first... 
  \E4 There's something I  have to do. 
   Right now, I can feel  everyone's hearts  beating as one. 
   They're all burning  with the same  desire. 
   With everyone's power... With everyone's  determination... 
   It's time for  monsters... 
   To finally go free. 
  \E7 Frisk... 
   I have to go now. 
  \E7 Without the power of  everyone's souls... 
   I can't keep  maintaining this  form. 
   In a little while... 
   I'll turn back into  a flower. 
  \E3 I'll stop being   + '' + myself. + '' +  
   I'll stop being able  to feel love again. 
   So... Frisk. 
  \E7 It's best if you  just forget about  me, OK? 
   Just go be with  the people who  love you. 
  \TS \F0 \T0

   So, Alphys... 
  \E9 What do you want  to do now that  we're all free? 
   We have the whole  world to explore  now. 
  \E3 W-well, of course  I'm going to go  out and... 
  \E4 Um... 
  \E3 No, I should be  honest!! 
   I'm gonna stay inside  and watch anime like  a total loser! 
  THAT'S THE SPIRIT! 
  EVERYONE!!!A CELEBRATION!!!TO BEING LOSERS!! 
  \E9 Heh. Papyrus has the  right idea. 
   Losing to Frisk is  the best thing to  ever happen to me. 
   So I'm glad that  we... 
  \E9 Huh? What is it, Asgore? 
   Um... what's an... 
   ... anime? 
   Oh My God? 
  \E3 Frisk. Please. 
   Help me explain what  anime is to Asgore.

   So it's like a  cartoon... But with guns?

   Boy! Technology sure is  something, isn't it? 
  \E5 Eheheh... yeah! It sure is! 
   Psst... F-Frisk. 
  \E3 Um, you've gotta  tell me. 
  \E6 D... do you think  Asgore and Toriel  are...? 
  \E3 Uh, ever gonna get  back together?

  \E7 Just think about how  cute they must have  been together. 
   It's quickly becoming  my number one ship  of all time. 
  \E7 Tori and Gorey... 
  \E5 My... My old boss and  his ex-wife. 
  \E8 ... uh, that sounds  a lot less cool  all of a sudden. 
  \E8 ... yeah, that's what  I thought. 
  \E7 A woman can dream  though, right? 
   And write fanfiction. 
   A LOT of fanfiction. 
   Frisk! I just realized! 
  \E3 Now that we aren't  fighting each  other... 
   I can finally ask  you... 
    + '' + Would you like a  cup of tea? + '' +

  \E3 Actually, the cup I  had is cold now. 
   So you shouldn't  have it. 
   But, I am so  happy you said  yes. 
   As soon as I can,  I will make some  more for you. 
   Then we can be  great pals. 
  \E3 Oh... 
  \E3 Okay. 
   Frisk! Stop! You're breaking his  big burly heart! 
   Um, it's OK, Undyne. 
   My heart's already  broken. 
  \E6 ASGORE! STOP! YOU'RE BREAKING MY  BIG BURLY HEART! 
  \E9 Y-yeah, Asgore. Don't break Undyne's  heart. 
   That's my job. 
   OH MY GOD! YOU'RE GOING BACK  IN THE TRASH!!! 
  CAN I GO IN THETRASH TOO? 
  \E9 Sure, Papyrus. 
   guess i have to  go in the trash  too. 
   Oh, may I enter  the trash as well? 
   Uh, okay? 
   Am I invited to  the trash? 
  \E6 SURE!!! WHY NOT!!! 
   On second thought,  do not put me  in the trash.

   Turn it on?          Yes         No 
    
   There's no lightbulb. A flashlight is stuck in  the bulb socket. 
   Turn it on?          Yes         No 
    
    
   The flashlight is out of  batteries. 
    
   Hey, hey! Did you remember my name? 
   Did you?          Yes         No 
    
   Wh-WHAT!? You REMEMBER!? 
   How could I be so easily  defeateeeeeeeeed!? 
   Wh-WHAT!? You DON'T REMEMBER!? 
   How could I be so easily  defeateeeeeeeeed!? 
   It's a small white dog. It's fast asleep... 
   Fight the dog?          Yes         No 
    
   Can't fight the dog. 
   Seems like the fabric it's  sleeping on has too many  holes in it. 
   Seems like the dog needs  to  + '' + patch + '' +  the fabric. 
   Then you can fight the dog. ... maybe. 
   Upon closer examination,  the holes in the fabric  seem to be growing. 
   Might take a while for the  dog to fix all of them. 
   Dogs aren't usually very  good at knitting. 
   A crocheting dog is out of  the question. 
   Let sleeping dogs lie, instead  of fighting them. That's how the saying goes. 
   Knock knock. 
   Oooooaaah ! Room service ! 
   Got my  + '' + Sea Tea + '' +  ?          Yes         No 
    
   Room service never came . Sigh ... 
   Thanks a million . 
   No response. 
   You pour the Sea Tea under  the door. 
   HUH !?!?!?!? That's just the way I want ! Here's a tip . 
   You got 99G. 
   ... No you don't . 
   Then ...!? 
   Knock knock. 
   Oooooaaah ! Room service ! 
   Got my  + '' + Cinnamon Bun + '' +  ?          Yes         No 
    
   Room service never came . Sigh ... 
   Thanks a trillion . 
   No response. 
   You flatten the Cinnamon Bun  until it's paper thin. You slide it under the door. 
   HUH !?!?!?!? That's just the way I want ! Here's a tip . 
   You got 99G. 
   ... No you don't . 
   Then ...!? 
   You hear shuffling. 
   Seems like you could put  something under the door. 
             Put         No Put 
    
   No response. 
   ... 
   But you didn't have anything  appealing. 
   You put a Hot Dog in front  of the door. 
   A white paw shoots out from  under the door. 
   It tries to pull the Hot Dog  into its room... 
   But it keeps pressing down too  hard, and the hot dog keeps  spinning away. 
   ... 
   It finally succeeds. 
   ... 
   You hear the grinding of  stone. 
   A single hushpuppy slides  out from under the door. 
   You got Hush Puppy. 
   You put a Hot Cat in front  of the door. 
   You hear growling... 
   You put a Dog Salad in front  of the door. It slides underneath. 
   ... 
   The Dog Salad was absorbed  by the darkness. 
   You put a Dog Residue in  front of the door. 
   It slides underneath the door,  as if pulled by a magnet. 
   ... 
   ZOMMM!!! It shoots back out at a  high speed! 
   Two Dog Residues slowly slide  back out from underneath  the door. 
    
   Yes, we know. The elevator to the city  is NOT working. 
   Because of this incident, rooms  are running at a special rate! 
   200G a room. Interested?          Stay        Do not 
    
   200G a room. Interested?          Stay        Do not 
    
   Did you enjoy your stay? 
   What? Room... Key? 
   No, we don't do that. 
   If you leave your room,  you'll have to pay again. 
   200G a room. Interested?          Stay        Do not 
    
   Fabulous! We'll escort you to your  room!

   ... MY ONE TRUE LOVE? 
   ... 
   YOU LOOK BORED, DARLING. 
   I WANT THIS TO BE A STELLAR  PERFORMANCE, SO IF YOU  WON'T GIVE IT YOUR ALL... 
   THEN I'LL SKIP AHEAD FOR  THE AUDIENCE'S SAKE. 
   Perform?          Yeah        Skip this 
    
   UNDERSTOOD. LET'S KNOCK 'EM DEAD! 
   KA-SIGH... THE SHOW MUST GO ON! 
  Interesting. 
  You want to go back. 
  You want to go backto the worldyou destroyed. 
  It was you who pushedeverything to its edge. 
  It was you who led the worldto its destruction. 
  But you cannot accept it. 
  You think you are aboveconsequences.         Yes         No 
   
  Exactly. 
  Then what are you looking for? 
  Perhaps. 
  We can reach a compromise. 
  You still have somethingI want. 
  Give it to me. 
  And I will bring thisworld back. 
             Yes         No 
   
  Then it is agreed. 
  You will give me your SOUL.          Yes         No 
    
  Then stay here forall eternity. 
    
  ... 
  Then, it is done. 
  Then stay here forall eternity. 
    
   hey. 
   is your refrigerator  running? 
             yes         no

   Somewhere, signals deflected  by a dog. 
   No response. Their phone might be out  of batteries. 
   The box is aclog with the  the hair of a dog. 
   You encountered the Dummy. 
   
   Froggit attacks you! 
   
   Froggit hopped close! 
   
   Whimsun approached meekly!

   Dog Shrine. 
   Donate?          Dognate     Dognot 
   \[1] of \[2]G in the box.          Dognate     Dognot 
   Looks like the money was used  to buy some fairy lights. 
   It was kind of dark in here. 
   Looks like the money was used  to increase the size of the  shrine. 
   The donation box slot is even  bigger now. 
   You should be able to donate  even more at once! 
   ... actually, it looks like  the sides of the slot are  just painted on... 
   Seems you'll still have to  donate just 1G at a time... 
   The donation box is sealed. 
   There was seemingly no point  to all of this... 
   Since your adventure is over,  you can reminisce about how  useful the Dog Shrine was... 
   ... it wasn't useful at all. 
   Something is wrong with  the box. 
   The box is full. 
   Not enough money. 
   That's relieving... 
   You donated 1G. 
   You put 1G into the box. 
   You feel like you're about to  waste a lot of time... 
   Clink! The box is filled with coins. 
   Perhaps if you leave and  return, the donations will be  used for something. 
   You feel a sense of relief. 
   Donation box.          Use It      Do not 
   ... hand can't fit inside. 
   Check it again to try  donating. 
   Right. 
   The boombox is playing... An upbeat song. 
   It's having a psychological  effect on your desire to  donate. 
   ... It's not clear what kind  of effect that is. 
   Change the track?          Change      Do not 
   Huh!? The next track is just the  same but faster...!? 
   You see no reason to  change it. 
   You returned the song  to normal. 
   \[1]G inside.          Donate      Do not 
   1G was put inside. 
   Not enough G. 
   There's enough.

 obj_adate_1751, \F0See you later! 
 obj_alabdoor_l_153,  There's no response. 
 obj_alabdoor_l_207,  ... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_208,  O-oh n-no, is that another  letter...? 
 obj_alabdoor_l_209,  I don't want to open it... C-can't I just slide it  back out...? 
 obj_alabdoor_l_210,  ... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_211,  N... no... I can't keep doing  this. I'll read this one. 
 obj_alabdoor_l_212,  ... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_213,  Um... I-it's shut k-kind of  strongly, isn't it? 
 obj_alabdoor_l_214,  Wait a second... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_252,  Hey, if this is a  joke, it's... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_253,  ... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_254, \E3 Oh My God? 
 obj_alabdoor_l_255, \E5 Did YOU write this  letter? 
 obj_alabdoor_l_256, \E6 It wasn't signed, so,  I had no idea who  could have... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_257, \E8 Oh my god. Oh no. 
 obj_alabdoor_l_258, \E7 That's adorable... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_259, \E5 And I h-had no idea  you, um, wrote that way! 
 obj_alabdoor_l_260, \E9 It's surprising, too... After all the gross  stuff I did... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_261, \E8 I don't really deserve  to be forgiven. 
 obj_alabdoor_l_262, \E4 Much less, um... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_263, \E5 This? 
 obj_alabdoor_l_264,  And so passionately,  too. 
 obj_alabdoor_l_265,  ... 
 obj_alabdoor_l_266,  You know what, okay! I'll do it! 
 obj_alabdoor_l_267, \E5 It's the least I can  do to make it up  to you! 
 obj_alabdoor_l_268, \W\E7 Y-yeah! \WLet's \Rgo on a date\W! 
 obj_alphys_friendc_81,  On second thought,  maybe I WON'T write  fanfic of real people. 
 obj_alphys_friendc_82, \E7 I mean, isn't real life  already the greatest  fanfiction of all? 
 obj_alphys_friendc_83, \E8 ... 
 obj_alphys_friendc_84, \E3 Uh, don't tell  anyone I said that. 
 obj_alphys_friendc_85,  Cause I'm gonna  post it online! 
 obj_alphys_friendc_90,  I sure am excited  to finally use the  human internet. 
 obj_alphys_friendc_91, \E7 I bet they have all  sorts of things Undyne  and I can watch! 
 obj_alphys_friendc_93, \E6 Oh man!!! 
 obj_alphys_friendc_94,  We're gonna be  able to watch  anime online!? 
 obj_alphys_friendc_96, \E7 Of course, Undyne! 
 obj_alphys_friendc_97,  What do you think  we've been fighting  for all along? 
 obj_alphys_friendc_99,  yeah, what do you... 
 obj_alphys_friendc_100,  whoops. 
 obj_alphys_friendc_102,  Jinx! I knew you were  gonna make that joke! 
 obj_alphys_friendc_104, \E3WAIT, ALPHYS, IDIDN'T KNOW YOUKNEW SANS. 
 obj_alphys_friendc_106, \E5 Well... I... 
 obj_alphys_friendc_108,  doesn't everybody? 
 obj_alphys_friendc_110,  Who the hell is Sans? 
 obj_alphys_friendc_111, \E8 ... 
 obj_alphys_friendc_112,  Who the HECK is Sans? 
 obj_alphys_friendc_114,  TORIEL!?!?! 
 obj_alphys_friendc_119,  Hey Frisk, why  don't you go look  for Mettaton? 
 obj_alphys_friendc_120, \E8 He was here for  a while, too... 
 obj_alphys_friendc_121,  But he said he  had to go somewhere. 
 obj_alphys_npc_76,  Th-that last  question... 
 obj_alphys_npc_77, \E4 He wasn't s-supposed  to ask that one... 
 obj_alphys_npc_82,  Yellow feet are tapping  just behind the door. 
 obj_alphys_npc_91,  I... I just need  a moment. 
 obj_alphys_npc_99,  ... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_108,  S... Sorry about  that! 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_109, \E5 L-let's k-keep  going! 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_148,  S-so you're about  to meet ASGORE,  h-huh? 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_149, \E6 You must be... Y-you must be... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_150, \E5 Pr... pretty  excited about all  that, huh? 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_175,  You'll f-f-finally... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_176, \E7 You'll finally get  to go home! 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_206,  W... Wait! 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_228,  I mean, um... I... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_229,  I was just going  to... ...um... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_230,  Say goodbye, and... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_231,  ... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_232, \E3 ... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_233, \E4 ... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_234,  I can't take  this anymore. 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_262,  I... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_263, \E5 I lied to you. 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_264, \E7 A human SOUL isn't  strong enough to  cross the barrier alone. 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_265, \E6 It takes at least  a human soul... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_266, \E5 And a monster  soul. 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_267, \E5 ... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_295,  If you want to  go home... 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_296, \E5 You'll have to  take his soul. 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_297, \E7 You'll have to  kill ASGORE. 
 obj_alphysfollow_event_345,  I'm sorry. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_166,  Oh. My god. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_175,  I didn't expect you  to show up so  soon! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_176,  I haven't showered, I'm  barely dressed, it's  all messy, and... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_224,  Ummm... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_225,  H-h-hiya! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_226,  I'm Dr. Alphys. I'm ASGORE's royal  scientist! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_227, \E3 B-b-but, ahhhh,  I'm not one of  the  + '' + bad guys + '' + ! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_228,  Actually, since you  stepped out of the  RUINS, I've, um... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_229, \E7 ... been  + '' + observing + '' +   your journey through  my console. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_230, \E3 Your fights... Your friendships... Everything! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_231,  I was originally  going to stop  you, but... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_236, \E7 Watching someone on  a screen really makes  you root for them. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_237, \E7 Watching you, I felt  like... like I was  seeing an old friend. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_238,  S-so, ahhh, now I  want to help you! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_239, \E6 Using my knowledge,  I can easily guide  you through Hotland! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_240,  I know a way right  to ASGORE's castle,  no problem! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_241,  ... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_242, \E7 Well, actually, umm,  there's just a  tiny issue. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_243,  A long time ago, I  made a robot named  Mettaton. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_244,  Originally, I built  him to be an  entertainment robot. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_245, \E7 Uh, you know, like  a robotic TV star  or something. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_246,  Anyway, recently I  decided to make him  more useful. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_247, \E7 You know, just some  small practical  adjustments. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_248,  Like, um... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_249, \E4 Anti... anti-human  combat features? 
 obj_alphystrigger1_250, \E6 Of c-course, when I  saw you coming, I  immediately decided... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_251, \E3 I have to remove  those features! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_252, \E4 Unfortunately, I may  have made a teensy  mistake while doing so. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_253,  And, um... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_254, \E5 Now he's an unstoppable  killing machine with a  thirst for human blood? 
 obj_alphystrigger1_255,  Ehehehehe... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_256, \E8 Heh. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_257,  But, ummm, hopefully  we won't run into  him! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_288,  ...? 
 obj_alphystrigger1_312,  Did you hear  something? 
 obj_alphystrigger1_344,  Oh no. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_393,  OHHHH YES! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_394,  WELCOME, BEAUTIES... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_441, \M1 ... TO TODAY'S QUIZ SHOW!!!

 obj_alphystrigger1_469, \M2 EVERYONE GIVE A BIG  HAND FOR OUR WONDERFUL  CONTESTANT! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_493, \M0 NEVER PLAYED BEFORE,  GORGEOUS? 
 obj_alphystrigger1_494, \M2 NO PROBLEM! IT'S SIMPLE! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_495, \M4 THERE'S ONLY ONE  RULE. 
 obj_alphystrigger1_496,  ANSWER CORRECTLY... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_514,  OR YOU DIE!!! 
 obj_alphystrigger1_566,  ... 
 obj_alphystrigger1_567,  Well that was  certainly something. 
 obj_alphystrigger2_87,  Wait, wait! 
 obj_alphystrigger2_146,  Let me give you my  ph-phone number! 
 obj_alphystrigger2_147, \E7 Th-then... m-maybe... If you need help,  I could... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_169, \E3 Wh... where'd you get  that phone!? It's ANCIENT! 
 obj_alphystrigger2_170,  It doesn't even have  texting. 
 obj_alphystrigger2_171, \E3 W-wait a second,  please! 
 obj_alphystrigger2_221,  Here, I upgraded it  for you! 
 obj_alphystrigger2_222,  It can do texting,  items, it's got a  key chain... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_223,  I even signed you up  for the underground's  No. 1 social network! 
 obj_alphystrigger2_224, \E7 Now we're officially  friends! Ehehehe! 
 obj_alphystrigger2_225,  Heheh... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_226,  Heh... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_227,  ... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_228,  ... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_229,  ... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_230,  ... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_231,  ... 
 obj_alphystrigger2_232, \E4 I'm going to the  bathroom. 
 obj_amalgam_fridge_99,  It's a refrigerator. It's empty. 
 obj_amalgam_fridge_103,  It's some sort of cold,  rectangular object. 
 obj_amalgam_fridge_107,  You found a blue key on  the ground. You put it on your keychain. 
 obj_artclass_sign_208,  Art Club: Meet here! Next meeting: October 10th 8PM 
 obj_artclass_sign_213,  Art club is cancelled! 
 obj_artclass_sign_218,  Art is dead. 
 obj_artclass_sign_224,  Let's meet again someday! 
 obj_artclass_sign_231,  Who knows what lies in the  future for Art Club!? 
 obj_artclass_sign_281,  Ahhhh!!! I'm late!!! I'm late!!! 
 obj_artclass_sign_282,  I'm so sorry!!! 
 obj_asgore_finalintro_178,  A strange light fills the  room.^5    
 obj_asgore_finalintro_179,  Twilight is shining through  the barrier.^3    
 obj_asgore_finalintro_180,  It seems your journey is  finally over.^4 
 obj_asgore_finalintro_181,       You're filled with          DETERMINATION.^5  
 obj_asgore_finalintro_213, Human... 
 obj_asgore_finalintro_214, It wasnice tomeetyou. 
 obj_asgore_finalintro_215, Goodbye. 
 obj_asgore_finalintro_220, Now,now.

 obj_asgore_finalintro_223, Over anice cupof tea? 
 obj_asgore_finalintro_496,  ASGORE attacks! 
 obj_asgore_friendc_76,  Howdy, Frisk. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_77, \E3 Sorry about almost  trying to take  your SOUL. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_78, \E5 I feel very bad  about it. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_79,  I hope we can  still be pals. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_81,  Hey, don't worry  about it, ASGORE. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_82,  I think everybody's  tried to kill Frisk  at least once. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_84,  Oh... I see! 
 obj_asgore_friendc_85,  In that case, I'm  not sorry, Frisk. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_87, \E6 ASGORE! That's not what I  meant! 
 obj_asgore_friendc_97, \E3 Oh, Frisk, if you're  not busy... 
 obj_asgore_friendc_98,  On nice days, you  should walk around and  have a good time. 
 obj_asgore_friendc_99,  That's important. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_243, Ah... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_244, ... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_245, So thatis howit is. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_246, ... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_251, \E3Why...You... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_275, I remember the dayafter my sondied. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_276, The entire undergroundwas devoid of hope. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_277, The future had onceagain been takenfrom us by thehumans. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_278, In a fit of anger,I declared war. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_279, I said that I woulddestroy any humanthat came here. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_280, I would use theirsouls to becomegodlike... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_281, ... and free us fromthis terrible prison. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_282, Then, I would destroyhumanity... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_283, And let monsters rulethe surface, in peace. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_284, Soon, the people'shopes returned. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_285, My wife, however,became disgusted withmy actions. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_286, She left this place,never to be seenagain. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_294, Truthfully... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_295, I do not want power. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_296, I do not want tohurt anyone. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_297, I just wanted everyoneto have hope... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_298, But... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_299, I cannot take thisany longer. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_300, I just want tosee my wife. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_301, I just want tosee my child. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_302, Please...Young one... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_303, This war has goneon long enough. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_304, You have the power... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_305, Take my soul, andleave this cursedplace. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_340, ... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_341, After everything Ihave done tohurt you... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_342, \E7You would ratherstay down hereand suffer... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_343, \E9Than live happilyon the surface? 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_344, \E6... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_352, Human... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_353, \E7I promise you... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_354, \E7For as long asyou remain here... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_355, My wife and I willtake care of youas best we can. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_356, We can sit inthe living room,telling stories... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_357, Eating butterscotchpie... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_358, We could belike... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_359, \E8Like a family... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_623, YouIDIOT. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_627, \[C]. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_628, Youhaven'tlearneda thing. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_632, Heeheehee. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_633, So youfinallyget it. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_639, \[C]. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_640, So youDOrecall. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_651, Inthisworld... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_692, It's KILL or BE killed^4. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_769, Hee hee hee.Don't worry. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_770, I know there's noREAL point infighting you. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_771, The human soulswould probably justrevolt again. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_772, So...! 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_778, Hee hee hee. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_779, Did you REALLYthink killing mewould make aDIFFERENCE? 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_780, No. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_781, Every time youload your SAVE,I'll come back. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_782, And every time youtry to get ahappy ending... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_783, I'll be there totear it away! 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_784, Ha ha ha!!! 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_792, Well, let's getthis over with. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_796, ... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_831, ... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_832, No.That's just afantasy, isn't it? 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_833, Young one, when Ilook at you... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_834, I'm reminded of thehuman that fell herelong ago... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_835, \E8You have the samefeeling of hope inyour eyes. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_836, \E7There is an ancientprophecy among ourpeople... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_837, One day, a saviorwill come from theheavens. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_838, ... I believe theone that wasprophecied was you. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_839, Somewhere in theworld outside... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_840, There must be a wayto free us from ourprison. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_841, It pains me togive you thisresponsiblity, but... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_842, Please.Take my soul...and seek the truth. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_898, Ha... ha... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_899, \E6I'm sorry... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_900, I couldn't give youa simple, happyending... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_901, But I believe yourfreedom... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_902, ... is what my son... 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_903, \E8... what ASRIEL wouldhave wanted. 
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_979, See?I never betrayedyou!  
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_980, It was all atrick, see?  
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_981, I was waiting tokill him for you!

 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_995, I can help...I can...I can...  
 obj_asgore_lastcutscene_1006, \E3Please don'tkill me. 
 obj_asgore_prebarrier_event_78,  How tense... 
 obj_asgore_prebarrier_event_79,  Just think of it like... 
 obj_asgore_prebarrier_event_80,  A visit to the dentist. 
 obj_asgore_prebarrier_event_112,  Are you ready? 
 obj_asgore_prebarrier_event_113, \E3 If you are not, I  understand. 
 obj_asgore_prebarrier_event_114,  I am not ready either. 
 obj_asgoreb_652,  ... 
 obj_asgoreb_658,  Asgore has low HP. 
 obj_asgoreb_692,  ASGORE 80 ATK 80 DEF ^ 
 obj_asgoreb_705,  But there was nothing to  say.^ 
 obj_asgoreb_711,  You quietly tell ASGORE  you don't want to fight  him. 
 obj_asgoreb_712,  His hands tremble for a  moment.^ 
 obj_asgoreb_716,  You tell ASGORE that you  don't want to fight him. 
 obj_asgoreb_717,  His breathing gets funny  for a moment.^ 
 obj_asgoreb_721,  You firmly tell ASGORE to  STOP fighting. 
 obj_asgoreb_722,  Recollection flashes in his  eyes... 
 obj_asgoreb_723,  ASGORE's ATTACK dropped! ASGORE's DEFENSE dropped!^ 
 obj_asgoreb_729,  Seems talking won't do any  more good.^ 
 obj_asgoreb_731,  All you can do is FIGHT.^ 
 obj_asgoreb_748,  You tell ASGORE that he's  killed you \[1]. 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_1, once before 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_2, twice before 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_3, three times 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_4, four times 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_5, five times 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_6, six times 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_7, seven times 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_8, eight times 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_9, nine times 
 obj_asgoreb_killcount_10, too many times  to count 
 obj_asgoreb_749,  He nods sadly.^ 
 obj_asgoreb_751,  He nods grievously.^ 
 obj_asgoreb_753,  He nods pitifully.^ 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_131,  Dum dee dum... 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_132,  Oh? Is someone there? 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_133,  Just a moment! 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_134,  I have almost finished watering  these flowers. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_138,  Curious. I've never seen a plant... Cry before. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_162,  ... Here we are! 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_193,  Howdy! How can I... 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_224,  Oh. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_247, \E3 ... 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_248,  I so badly want to  say,  + '' + would you like  a cup of tea? + '' +  
 obj_asgoremeet_event_249,  But... 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_250, \E3 You know how it is. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_289,  Nice day today, huh? 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_290,  Birds are singing,  flowers are blooming... 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_291,  Perfect weather for a  game of catch. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_313,  ... 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_314,  You know what we must  do. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_315,  When you are ready,  come into the next  room. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_369, \E3 ... huh? 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_370,  You must be the one  that flower just warned  me about. 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_371,  Howdy! 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_372,  ... 
 obj_asgoremeet_event_373, \E3 Erm... What kind of monster  are you...?

 obj_asrielbed_89,  You are the future  of humans and  monsters... 
 obj_asrielbed_93,  It felt strange to lie  in the bed. 
 obj_asrielbed_94,  It feels entirely too  small for you now. 
 obj_asrielfinal_58,  You feel something faintly  resonating within ASRIEL.

 obj_asrielfinal_470,  It seems that there's still  one last person that needs  to be saved. 
 obj_asrielfinal_471,  But who...? 
 obj_asrielfinal_472,  ...

 obj_darksausagenpc_72,  Why do I look like a weird  black sausage? Just the angle. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_76,  As a youth, I would sneak  out to play by this creepy  flaming pit. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_77,  Since the CORE is always  re-arranging, it was like  a game trying to find it. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_78,  Now it is my special place. It is nice for cooking s'mores  and things like that. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_83,  We were hired by Mettaton  to destroy you. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_84,  But since he never paid us,  we all decided to quit. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_85,  No hard feelings. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_90,  Zzzzzzz... 
 obj_darksausagenpc_91,  It's taking a nap. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_96,  Why do I look like a black  sausage and not a knight  or a wizard? 
 obj_darksausagenpc_97,  Well... Everyone has an angle they  look best from.. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_102,  The core is made up of  interchangable rooms. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_103,  Before you came here, the  layout was altered so you  would get lost and perish. 
 obj_darksausagenpc_104,  Yes. Just for you. Do you feel special? 
 obj_darksink_91,  Error. 
 obj_darksink_98,  You turned on the sink. 
 obj_darksink_100,  You really like to wash  your hands. 
 obj_darksink_110,  You turned off the sink. 
 obj_darksink_122,  You turned on the sink. 
 obj_darksink_132,  There's a red key lying  in the sink. 
 obj_darksink_133,  You took it and put it  on your keychain.

 obj_diamondkid_73, \W My fave Mettaton MomentTM? Right \Ywhen everything looks the  baddest, he poses dramatically\W. 
 obj_diamondkid_74,  Like when he's on a cooking  show and the eggs don't turn  out right. 
 obj_diamondkid_78,  But! Then he says! 
 obj_diamondkid_79, \W Even if you suck at cooking,  you can always \Ybuy an  MTT-brand Glamburger\W! 
 obj_diamondkid_80, \W Then he \Yeats one!\W  Everyone loves it! 
 obj_diamondkid_81,  ... How does he eat it  without a mouth? 
 obj_diamondkid_82,  Uhhh... well... Watch the show! 
 obj_diamondkid_87,  That finale was really... That was really sad! 
 obj_diamondkid_88,  And Mettaton's schedule  doesn't show any other  shows... 
 obj_diamondkid_93,  I've been thinking about  getting a sick skateboard. 
 obj_diamondkid_98, \W My fave Mettaton MomentTM  is when he beats up the  \Yheel-turning villains\W! 
 obj_diamondkid_99,  Even if it's during what's  supposed to be a quiz show. 
 obj_diamondkid_106,  Oh! And I like when he tries  on all kinds of different  fashionable outfits! 
 obj_diamondkid_107,  Even if it's during what's  supposed to be a newscast. 
 obj_diamondkid_112,  Did Mettaton retire...? 
 obj_diamondkid_113,  Can't he unretire...? 
 obj_diamondkid_119,  On the surface we'll be able  to watch all kinds of TV... 
 obj_diamondkid_120,  But, I bet none of those  shows are as good as  Mettaton's! 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_60,  The door leading through  the area is closed? So I tried the puzzle? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_61,  But I kept running out of  ammo, and it kept restarting? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_62,  And my two co-workers won't  help? It's like they don't  even wanna go to work? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_63,  Why don't you try? Try using the console? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_67,  Wow? You solved it? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_68,  I'm impressed? You must be a total nerd? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_73,  So we're all gonna go  free...? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_74,  Does that mean I don't  get to go to work? 
 obj_disembodiedfoxhead_79,  Maybe I don't want to go  to work anymore...? 
 obj_dogboat_thing_400,  Tra la la. The waters are wild today. That's good luck... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_401,  Tra la la. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_402,  Tra la la. The waters are wild today. That's bad luck... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_403,  Tra la la. Eat a mushroom everyday. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_404,  Why? Then I know you're listening  to me... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_405,  Tra la la. Remember to take a break  every-so-often... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_406,  Tra la la. Did you ever hear the old  song coming from the sea? 
 obj_dogboat_thing_407,  Tra la la. What's inside an acorn? It's really just a mystery. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_408,  Tra la la. Dancing on a boat is danger. But good exercise... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_409,  Tra la la. I heard ASGORE has a favorite  food. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_410,  Tra la la. I heard spiders have a  favorite food. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_411,  It's spiders. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_412,  Tra la la. The piano plays the  tinkling song. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_413,  Hmm... tinkling. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_414,  Tra la la. You can never have too  many hot-dogs. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_415,  ... sadly, that's not true.

 obj_dogboat_thing_421,  ... don't worry about it. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_422,  Ah, 
 obj_dogboat_thing_423,  Tra la la. What's a game you can play  with a dog? 
 obj_dogboat_thing_424,  Asking for a friend... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_425,  Tra la la. Temmie Village... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_426,  ... the room before the  darkening lantern room. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_427,  Tra la la. Why don't you sing with me. Tra la la. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_428,  Tra la la. Uh oh. Suddenly, feeling tropical... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_429,  Tra la la. Hmmm... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_430,  I should have worn a few  more pairs of pants today. 
 obj_dogboat_thing_431,  Tra la la. Hmmm... 
 obj_dogboat_thing_432,  I should have worn a few  million more pairs of pants  today.

 obj_dogboat_thing_593,  Come again some time. Tra la la. 
 obj_dogetrigger1_108,  Did something move? Was it my imagination? 
 obj_dogetrigger1_109,  I can only see moving  things. 
 obj_dogetrigger1_110,  If something WAS moving... For example, a human... 
 obj_dogetrigger1_111,  I'll make sure it NEVER  moves again! 
 obj_dogetrigger1_114,  Did something move? Was it my imagination? 
 obj_dogetrigger1_115,  I can only see moving  things. 
 obj_dogetrigger1_116,  H... hey! I can't stop shivering  all of a sudden. 
 obj_dogetrigger1_117,  Who... who's there!? 
 obj_dogetrigger1_156,  S-S-S-Something pet me... Something that isn't  m-m-moving... 
 obj_dogetrigger1_157,  I'm gonna need some dog  treats for this!!! 
 obj_dogetrigger1_160,  A stick appeared out of  nowhere, then disappeared. 
 obj_dogetrigger1_161,  Was it a ghost stick? 
 obj_dogetrigger1_162,  Did I just return it to  the afterlife? 
 obj_dogetrigger1_163,  I need some dog treats  to think about this. 
 obj_dogfood_98,  Unfortunately, it's just  dry food. 
 obj_dogfood_99,  There's a hot dog cut up  into the kibble. 
 obj_dogfoodbag_57,  It's a half-empty bag  of dog food. 
 obj_dogfoodbag_59,  It's a bag of dog food. It's half-full. 
 obj_dogfoodbag_63,  It's a half-empty bag  of dog food. 
 obj_dogfoodbag_64,  ... 
 obj_dogfoodbag_65,  You just remembered  something funny. 
 obj_dogfoodbag_68,  It's too dark to see  near the walls. 
 obj_doggiebed_98,  It's too small to sleep  on. 
 obj_dogneckparent_99,  It's the broken head of  a snowdog. 
 obj_dogpillarparent_117,  Seems like the base of a  snowdog. 
 obj_dogpillarparent_118,  It's a pile of mushy snow. 
 obj_dogpillarparent_119,  This dog is staring blankly  into the snow, waiting for  it to turn into art. 
 obj_dogringbell_148,  Hello? Is anybody there...? No? 
 obj_dogringbell_149,  Are you two playing a trick  on me? Real funny. 
 obj_dogringbell_150,  Big guy? Is that you? Come on... 
 obj_dogringbell_151,  Well, it's not the tall  skeleton... He's too loud. 
 obj_dogringbell_152,  Whoever you are, knock it  off!!! 
 obj_dogringbell_153,  ... 
 obj_dogroom_npc_74,  That dog considers itself  an artist, but doesn't ever  know what to create. 
 obj_dogroom_npc_75,  It probably doesn't help  that its brain is the size  of a piece of kibble. 
 obj_dogroom_npc_79,  That dog from earlier...? It's at Grillby's. I think. 
 obj_dogroom_npc_80,  After work, all of the dogs  go there to play cards  together. 
 obj_dogroom_npc_81,  But that dog doesn't really  know how to express itself. 
 obj_dogroom_npc_82,  So, it ends up playing alone,  instead of introducing  itself to the others... 
 obj_dogroom_npc_87,  A dog just rushed in here,  filled with inspiration. 
 obj_dogroom_npc_88,  It kept trying to build  a snowdog that expressed  its own emotions... 
 obj_dogroom_npc_89,  But, as it built, it  kept getting more excited  about the sculpture... 
 obj_dogroom_npc_90,  Its neck got longer and  longer, and it added more  and more snow, until... 
 obj_dogroom_npc_91,  It was rather sad to watch,  but I couldn't turn away. 
 obj_dogroom_npc_96,  We're all free? 
 obj_dogroom_npc_97,  OK, OK... I'll stop lounging around. Does that dog know? 
 obj_dogroom_npc_98,  ... it probably doesn't,  does it...? 
 obj_dogtreat_99,  Someone's been smoking  dog treats.

 obj_dummymonster_213,  ..... 
 obj_dummymonster_222,  
 obj_dummymonster_394,  Dummy looks like it's  going to fall over. 
 obj_dummymonster_395,  Dummy stands around  absentmindedly.

 obj_dummymonster_437,  DUMMY - ATK 0 DEF 0  A cotton heart and a button eye You are the apple of my eye 
 obj_dummymonster_445,  You talk to the DUMMY. ... 
 obj_dummymonster_446,  It doesn't seem much for  conversation. 
 obj_dummymonster_447,  TORIEL seems happy with you. 
 obj_dummytrigger_222,  Hahaha... It's just like you to  run away. 
 obj_dummytrigger_223,  FOOL! You think you can hurt  ME??? 
 obj_dummytrigger_224,  Hahaha... Too intimidated to fight  me, huh!? 
 obj_dummytrigger_225,  I am a ghost that lives  inside a DUMMY. 
 obj_dummytrigger_226,  My cousin used to live  inside a DUMMY, too. Until... 
 obj_dummytrigger_229,  YOU CAME ALONG! 
 obj_dummytrigger_230,  They were a shy sort. Living a lonely life in  the RUINS... 
 obj_dummytrigger_231,  They saw you and hoped you  might TALK to them. 
 obj_dummytrigger_232,  Perhaps strike up a  friendly conversation. 
 obj_dummytrigger_233,  But NO!!! 
 obj_dummytrigger_234,  You ran away... And broke their little  ethereal heart. 
 obj_dummytrigger_235,  Despicable. Despicable! DESPICABLE! 
 obj_dummytrigger_236,  HUMAN! I'll show you what REAL  heartbreak is! 
 obj_dummytrigger_241,  YOU DESTROYED THEIR HOME! 
 obj_dummytrigger_242,  Us ghosts spend our whole  lives looking for a  proper vessel. 
 obj_dummytrigger_243,  Slowly, slowly, we grow  closer to our new  bodies... 
 obj_dummytrigger_244,  Until one day, we too  may become corporeal  beings. 
 obj_dummytrigger_245,  Beings able to laugh,  love, and dance like  any other... 
 obj_dummytrigger_246,  But YOU!!!! My cousin's future...! You took it all away! 
 obj_dummytrigger_251,  Despicable. Despicable! DESPICABLE! 
 obj_dummytrigger_252,  HUMAN! I hope you're not too  attached to YOUR body... 
 obj_dummytrigger_253,  Because your SOUL's about  to get EVICTED!!! 
 obj_dummytrigger_257,  YOU CAME ALONG! 
 obj_dummytrigger_258,  When you talked to them,  they thought they were  in for a nice chat... 
 obj_dummytrigger_259,  But the things you  SAID...! 
 obj_dummytrigger_260,  Horrible. Shocking! UNBELIEVABLE! 
 obj_dummytrigger_261,  It spooked them right  out of their dummy! 
 obj_dummytrigger_262,  HUMAN! I'll scare your SOUL  out of your body! 
 obj_dummytrigger_267,  YOU...! 
 obj_dummytrigger_268,  You... 
 obj_dummytrigger_269,  Shucks! You were really boring! 
 obj_dummytrigger_270,  They got annoyed and flew  away like any self-  respecting spectre. 
 obj_dummytrigger_271,  Well then. Well then! WELL THEN! 
 obj_dummytrigger_272,  Boring people are crumbs  sticking to the face  of this world. 
 obj_dummytrigger_273,  Human! 
 obj_dummytrigger_274,  I'll wipe you away with  the dainty handkerchief  of vengeance! 
 obj_dummytrigger_279,  Hahaha... It's just like you to  run away.

 obj_dummytrigger_281,  Hahaha... Too intimidated to fight  me, huh!? 
 obj_dummytrigger_282,  I am a ghost that lives  inside a DUMMY. 
 obj_dummytrigger_283,  My cousin used to live  inside a DUMMY, too. Until... 
 obj_dummytrigger_284,  YOU CAME ALONG! 
 obj_dummytrigger_285,  Not only did YOUR actions  cause them to leave their  home... 
 obj_dummytrigger_286,  But now all of their neighbors  are gone, too! 
 obj_dummytrigger_287,  Despicable. Despicable! DESPICABLE!!!

 obj_dummytrigger_349,  no worries... 
 obj_dummytrigger_350,  just thought i'd  offer... 
 obj_dummytrigger_354,  well... i'm going to head home  now... 
 obj_dummytrigger_355,  just warning you... 
 obj_dummytrigger_356,  so you don't accidentally  follow me to my  house...

 obj_dummytrigger_418,  This... This feeling...? 
 obj_dummytrigger_427,  Eureka. Eureka! EUREKA! 
 obj_dummytrigger_428,  Human. That moment of unbridled  emotion. 
 obj_dummytrigger_429,  It allowed me to finally  fuse with my body! 
 obj_dummytrigger_430,  I'm fully corporeal now! My lifelong dream, realized! 
 obj_dummytrigger_431,  In return, I guess I  won't stomp you. 
 obj_dummytrigger_432,  How's that sound? 
 obj_echoflower_96,  Error! 
 obj_echoflower_104,  All that gives my life  validation is explaining  the Echo Flower... 
 obj_echoflower_105,  No one can know... 
 obj_echoflower_110,  This is an Echo Flower. It repeats the last thing  it heard, over and over... 
 obj_echoflower_114,  Neat, huh? 
 obj_echoflower_118,  Never trust a flower... That's one of the constants  of this world. 
 obj_echoflower_123,  It's strangely silent.

 obj_floweytrigger2_268,  Until you tire of  trying. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_269,  What will you do  then? 
 obj_floweytrigger2_270, \E5 Will you kill  out of frustration? 
 obj_floweytrigger2_271,  Or will you give  up entirely on  this world... 
 obj_floweytrigger2_272, \E4 ... and let ME inherit  the power to control  it? 
 obj_floweytrigger2_273, \E5 I am the prince of  this world's future. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_274,  Don't worry, my little  monarch, my plan  isn't regicide. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_275,  This is SO much  more interesting. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_283,  But don't act so  cocky. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_284,  I know what you did. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_285, \E6 You murdered her. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_286, \E7 And then you went  back, because you  regretted it. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_287,  Ha ha ha ha... 
 obj_floweytrigger2_288, \E5 You naive idiot. 
 obj_floweytrigger2_289,  Do you think you  are the only one  with that power?

 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_82, \W Everyone knows he sits  around in the forest  reading \Ycar magazines\W. 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_87,  Ehhhhhhhhnnnnn... I wish I had something else  to do. 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_92,  Those dogs are part of  the ROYAL GUARD, the... 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_93,  Huh? Where are they? 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_94,  Something feels really off. 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_101,  Wow, a brand new world... 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_102,  I might not get to  translate for Grillby  anymore... 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_103,  ... which is fine, since I  was actually just making  up what he was saying. 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_109,  Grillby is getting nervous. 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_110,  Sans is his best customer,  and he hasn't shown up  at all today... 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_115,  Something feels really bad. Our lives are going nowhere,  aren't they...? 
 obj_grillbynpc_hot2_116,  I think I need another  espresso... 
 obj_grillbynpc_hotandbothered_73,  No matter where I go,  it's the same menu, the  same people...

 obj_grillbynpc_hotandbothered_106,  C'mon Sansy! You're the life of the  party... 
 obj_grillbynpc_lesserdog_71,  It's playing poker against  itself. 
 obj_grillbynpc_lesserdog_72,  It appears to be losing. 
 obj_grillbynpc_lesserdog_76,  It has switched to Go Fish. 
 obj_grillbynpc_lesserdog_81,  It finally won a game of  poker against itself...? 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_75,  You better watch where you  sit down in here, kid. 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_76,  Because that big guy WILL jump  into your lap and give you  lots of love and attention. 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_80,  Where's Sans... He's supposed to give me  a pat on the head... 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_85,  She hasn't been responding  to our letters... 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_86,  Maybe it's because we let  Doggo write them all. 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_91,  I was hoping Sans came in  to give me a pat on the  head. 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_92,  Interloper...! 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_96,  Where's that big lug? We can't start until he  shows up. 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_98,  Smells kinda... quiet. 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_103,  Hmmm, now that our parents  are the same entity... 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_104,  Does that mean I'm  married to my sister? 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_105,  ... 
 obj_grillbynpc_mandog_106,  Wait, we're dogs. That stuff's normal. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_121,  fast shortcut, huh? 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_129,  hey, everyone. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_164,  Hey, Sans. Hi, Sans. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_208,  Greetings, Sans. Hiya, Sansy~ 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_245,  Hey Sans, weren't you just  here for breakfast a  few minutes ago? 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_247,  nah, i haven't had  breakfast in at least  half an hour. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_248,  you must be thinking  of brunch. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_286,  here, get comfy. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_521,  You tip the ketchup... 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_522,  The cap falls off and all  the ketchup in the bottle  pours onto your food.

 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_547,  i'm not hungry anyway. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_577,  anyway, cool or not,  you have to agree  papyrus tries real hard. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_578,  like how he keeps  trying to be part of  the royal guard. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_579,  one day, he went to  the house of the head  of the royal guard... 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_580,  and begged her to  let him be in it. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_581,  of course, she shut  the door on him because  it was midnight. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_582,  but the next day, she  woke up and saw him  still waiting there. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_583,  seeing his dedication,  she decided to give  him warrior training. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_584,  it's, uh, still a  work in progress. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_609,  oh yeah, I wanted  to ask you something. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_683,  welp, that was a  long break. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_684,  i can't believe i let  ya pull me away from  work for that long. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_708,  just kidding. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_709,  grillby, put it on  my tab. 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_751,  by the way... 
 obj_grillbynpc_sansdate_752,  ... i was going to say  something, but i forgot. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_76,  We're sentries, but we never  get any respect. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_77,  I wish those skeletons would  throw us a bone. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_78,  We love bones. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_81,  Where are those skeletons? I wanted to get a bone  from them... 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_86,  We're considering paying a  visit to the doctor. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_87,  No! Not the vet! ... well, maybe she's a  little like a vet. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_92,  I like Sans. Sometimes he feeds us scraps  of food under the table. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_93,  Then his brother gets mad... But why!? We're adults! We can handle it! 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_97,  Where's Doggo? I hope he didn't get  lost again. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_99,  It's lonely in here today. If our friends don't show up,  would you like to play? 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_105,  All of our parents have  been combined into one  horrible being. 
 obj_grillbynpc_womandog_106,  That's OK, though. It's really  + '' + brought our  families together. + '' +

 obj_judgeshroom_187,  Mushroom dance Mushroom dance Whatever could it mean 
 obj_judgeshroom_211,  It symbolizes my inner  pain. 
 obj_judgeshroom_213,  It symbolizes my inner  torment, trapped here  by my hyphae. 
 obj_judgeshroom_214,  My struggle to pull away. My struggle to escape. But alas, to no avail. 
 obj_judgeshroom_218,  If only I could see the  world above. 
 obj_judgeshroom_219,  But even if the barrier  was open, how would I  leave...? 
 obj_judgeshroom_224,  It means you've lived a  life of sin. 
 obj_judgeshroom_226,  It means... Don't talk to me. 
 obj_judgeshroom_231,  It symbolizes my unbridled  happiness. 
 obj_judgeshroom_232,  The government told me  they are willing to  transplant me outside! 
 obj_judgeshroom_233,  Why didn't you smile at my  dance? It almost feels  a little rude...

 obj_kitchenforcefield_124,  As per journalistic standards,  a death forcefield surrounds  the area of intrigue. 
 obj_kitchenforcefield_125,  It's the kind of every-day  death forcefield you see  at home. 
 obj_kitchenforcefield_126,  It's a forcefield.

 obj_knock_room_65,  Doesn't seem like  anyone's home. 
 obj_knock_room_67,  If someone's there,  they aren't answering  the door. 
 obj_knock_room_69,  No one is home. And you get the feeling  no one ever will be. 
 obj_knock_room_71,  You hear irritated groans  from the inside. 
 obj_knock_room_75,  Sounds like only fire  lives here now. 
 obj_knock_room_81,  Who's there? I'm in the middle of  my favorite TV program. 
 obj_knock_room_82,  I know, I know... Staring at a screen... Sounds like a boring hobby. 
 obj_knock_room_83,  But TV offers an escape  to another world. We really need that. 
 obj_knock_room_86,  You wanna watch too? Sorry, this is a one-player  TV show. 
 obj_knock_room_91,  Ahh, what a beautiful knock...! Maybe if I don't answer,  I'll hear it again. 
 obj_knock_room_93,  Ahh, my patience rewards me.

 obj_knock_room_113,  No answer. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_218,  Hey! Stop!!! 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_258,  I got you guys some  food, okay!? 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_294, \E4 Sorry about that... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_295,  They get kind of sassy  when they don't get  fed on time. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_296, \E3 Um!! 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_299, \E3 I think they smelled  the potato chips you  had, and... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_301, \E3 Anyway! 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_302, \E6 The power went out,  and I've been trying  to turn it back on! 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_303, \E4 But it seems like you  were one step ahead  of me. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_304,  This was probably just  a big inconvenience  for you... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_305, \E4 B-but I appreciate  that you came here  to back me up! 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_306, \E4 As I said, I was  afraid I might... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_307, \E8 Not come back... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_308, \E5 But that's not because  of these guys or  anything! 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_309, \E4 I was just worried I  would be too afraid... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_310, \E9 To tell the truth... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_311, \E8 That I might run away,  or do something... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_312, \E9 Cowardly. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_313,  ... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_314, \E8 Uh... I... I suppose I owe you  an explanation. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_315, \E9 As you probably know,  ASGORE asked me to study  the nature of SOULs. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_316, \E3 During my research, I  isolated a power I  called  + '' + determination. + '' +  
 obj_lab_powerswitch_317, \E6 I injected it into dying  monsters so their SOULs  would last after death. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_318, \E9 But the experiment  failed. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_319,  You see, unlike humans',  monsters' bodies don't  have enough... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_320,  Physical matter to take  those concentrations  of  + '' + determination. + '' +  
 obj_lab_powerswitch_321,  Their bodies started to  melt, and lost what  physicality they had. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_322, \E3 Pretty soon, all of the  test subjects had melted  together into... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_323, \E8 Those. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_324, \E9 Seeing them like this,  I knew... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_325, \E8 I couldn't tell their  families about it. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_326, \E8 I couldn't tell anyone  about it. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_327, \E9 No matter how much  everyone was asking me. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_328, \E9 And I was too afraid to  do any more work,  knowing... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_329, \E8 ... everything I'd done  so far had been such  a horrific failure. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_330, \E9 ... but now. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_331, \E9 Now, I've changed my  mind about all this. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_332, \E9 I'm going to tell  everyone what I've done. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_333, \E9 ... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_335,  It's going to be hard. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_336,  Being honest... Believing in myself... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_337,  I'm sure there will be  times where I'll  struggle. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_338,  I'm sure there will be  times where I screw  up again. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_339,  But knowing, deep down,  that I have friends  to fall back on... 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_340, \E7 I know it'll be a  lot easier to stand  on my own. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_341,  Thank you. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_406,  Come on, guys. 
 obj_lab_powerswitch_407,  It's time for everyone  to go home.

 obj_lastbeam_296,  ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_187,  So you finally made it. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_188,  The end of your journey  is at hand. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_189,  In a few moments, you  will meet the king. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_190,  Together... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_191,  You will determine the  future of this world. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_192,  That's then. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_193,  Now. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_194,  You will be judged. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_195,  You will be judged for  your every action. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_196,  You will be judged for  every EXP you've earned. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_197,  What's EXP? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_198,  It's an acronym. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_199, \W It stands for  + '' + \Rexecution  points\W. + '' +  
 obj_lastsans_trigger_200,  A way of quantifying the  pain you have inflicted on  others. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_201,  When you kill someone,  your EXP increases. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_202,  When you have enough EXP,  your LOVE increases. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_203,  LOVE, too, is an  acronym. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_204, \W It stands for  + '' + \RLevel of  Violence\W. + '' +  
 obj_lastsans_trigger_205,  A way of measuring someone's  capacity to hurt. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_206,  The more you kill, the  easier it becomes to  distance yourself. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_207,  The more you distance  yourself, the less you  will hurt. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_208,  The more easily you  can bring yourself to  hurt others. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_214,  So you finally made it... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_243,  Now, you understand. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_244,  It's time to begin your  judgment. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_245,  Look inside yourself. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_246,  Have you really done the  right thing? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_247,  And, considering what  you've done... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_248,  What will you do now? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_249,  Take a moment to think  about this. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_268, \TS ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_269, \Ts ... but you. you never gained  any LOVE. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_270,  'course, that doesn't  mean you're completely  innocent or naive. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_271,  just that you kept  a certain tenderness  in your heart. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_274,  no matter the struggles  or hardships you  faced... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_275,  you strived to do the  right thing. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_276,  you refused to hurt  anyone. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_277,  even when you ran  away, you did it  with a smile. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_278,  you never gained LOVE,  but you gained love. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_279,  does that make sense? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_280,  maybe not. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_283, \E3 ... now. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_284,  you're about to face  the greatest challenge  of your entire journey. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_285,  your actions here... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_286,  will determine the  fate of the entire  world. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_287,  if you refuse to  fight... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_288,  asgore will take  your soul and  destroy humanity. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_289,  but if you kill  asgore and go  home... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_290,  monsters will remain  trapped underground. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_291,  what will you do? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_292, \E3 ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_293,  well, if i were you,  i would have thrown  in the towel by now. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_294,  but you didn't get  this far by giving  up, did you? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_295,  that's right. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_296,  you have something  called  + '' + determination. + '' +  
 obj_lastsans_trigger_297,  so as long as you  hold on... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_298,  so as long as you  do what's in your  heart... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_299,  i believe you can do  the right thing. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_300, \E3 alright. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_301,  we're all counting  on you, kid. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_302,  good luck. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_361, \TS ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_362, \Ts truthfully, it doesn't  really matter what you  said. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_363,  all that's important is  that you were honest  with yourself. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_364,  what happens now... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_365,  we leave up to you. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_390,  Then why'd you  kill my  brother? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_402,  You dirty brother  killer. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_421,  huh? you look bored. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_422,  i get the feeling  you aren't gonna learn  anything from this. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_423,  well, guess I gotta  judge you then. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_424,  come on. really? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_428,  lv2... seems like you messed  up the slightest amount. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_429,  welp. that's pretty sad. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_430, \E3 you probably weren't  even aware of what you  were doing... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_431,  and when you learned,  it was too late. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_432,  nah, just kidding. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_433,  who gets to lv2 on  accident? get outta here. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_437, \E3 lv3... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_438,  3's just an ok number,  i guess. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_439,  i'll give you a C+. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_440,  you can do better,  right? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_444, \E3 hmmm... over lv3, huh. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_445,  you killed some people  on purpose, didn't you? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_446,  that's probably bad. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_447, \E3 though, maybe some  of it was in self-  defense... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_448,  i don't know. help me out here. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_449,  i wasn't watching. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_450,  anyways, don't do that. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_454, \E3 hmmm... over lv9, huh. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_455,  that's over halfway to  lv20, the maximum. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_456,  but don't think that  means you're still 50-  percent good. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_457, \E3 50-percent, 20-percent. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_458, \E4 those are both still  failing grades. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_459,  besides. chances are... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_460,  i've already tried to  steer you in the right  direction. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_461,  so what can i say? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_462, \E3 what can i say that  will change the mind of  a being like you...? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_466, \E3 hmmm... over lv14, huh. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_467,  well, hmmm... judgment-wise... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_468, \E4 you're a pretty bad  person. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_469,  you wander around,  looking for people... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_470,  killing them to take  their money. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_471, \E3 that's just plain  messed up. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_472,  and what's worse, is  that as bad as you  are... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_473,  you aren't anywhere near  as bad as you could  be. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_474,  you pretty much suck  at being evil. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_475,  honestly, it's super  embarrassing. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_476,  but maybe you'd be  better... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_477,  at not killing anyone? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_478,  crazy idea, huh? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_479,  let me know how that  one goes. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_485,  ... huh? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_486,  what's with that look  in your eye? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_487, \E3 did you go through and  kill someone... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_488, \E3 just to see what i'd  say about it? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_489,  wow. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_490,  you're a pretty gross  person, huh? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_494,  huh? you STILL look bored. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_495,  okay then, consider  our session over. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_513, \E3 ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_514,  wait a second. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_515,  that look on your  face while i was  talking... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_516,  you've already heard  my spiel, haven't you? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_517, \E3 i suspected something  like this. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_518, \E3 you're always acting  like you know what's  going to happen. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_519,  like you've seen it  all before. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_520, \E3 so... i have a request for  you. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_521, \W i kind of have a  \Ysecret codeword\W   that only i know. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_522,  so i know if someone  tells it to me... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_523,  they'll have to be a  time traveller. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_524,  crazy, right? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_525,  anyway, here it is... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_526, \E3 whisper, whisper 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_527,  i'm counting on you to  come back here and  tell me that. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_528,  see you later. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_532,  ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_533,  huh? do you have something  to say to me? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_534,  what? a codeword? can you speak a  little louder? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_535, \E3 ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_536,  did you... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_537,  ... just say  + '' + i'm a  stupid doodoo butt? + '' +  
 obj_lastsans_trigger_538,  wow. i can't believe you  would say that. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_539, \E3 not only is that  completely infantile... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_540,  but it's also my  secret codeword. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_541, \E3 that, however, isn't  good enough. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_542, \W what you need is the  \Ysecret\W secret codeword. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_543,  it's only for people  that know the secret  codeword. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_544,  anyway, here it is... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_545, \E4 whimsper, whimsper... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_546,  i'm counting on you to  come back here and  tell me that. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_547,  see you later. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_553,  ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_554,  huh? do you have something  to say to me? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_555,  what? a codeword? can you speak a  little louder? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_556, \E3 ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_557,  did you... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_558,  ... just say  + '' + i'm the  legendary fartmaster? + '' +  
 obj_lastsans_trigger_559,  wow. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_560,  that's... uh... really childish. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_561,  why would you think  that was a secret  secret codeword? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_562,  whoever told you that  is a dirty liar. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_563,  i don't have a secret  secret codeword. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_564, \E3 however. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_565,  i do have a secret  secret triple-secret  codeword. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_566,  which you just said. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_567,  so, i guess you're  qualified. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_568,  here's the key to my  room. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_569, \E3 it's time... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_570,  you learned the truth.

 obj_lastsans_trigger_572,  When you looked, the key was  already on your keychain. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_578,  ...

 obj_lastsans_trigger_635,  you've been busy,  huh? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_636,  ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_637,  so, i've got a  question for ya. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_638, \E3 do you think even  the worst person can  change...? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_639, \E3 that everybody can be  a good person, if  they just try? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_643,  heya. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_644,  you look frustrated  about something. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_645, \E4 guess i'm pretty good  at my job, huh? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_650,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_651,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  twice in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_652,  suffice to say, you  look really... unsatisfied. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_653, \E3 all right. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_654, \E4 how 'bout we make it  a third? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_659,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_660,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  thrice in a row.

 obj_lastsans_trigger_668,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_669,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  quice in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_670,  quice? frice? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_671, \E4 welp, won't have to  use it again anyways. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_676,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_677,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  five times in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_678,  convenient, huh? that's one for each  finger. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_679, \E3 but soon... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_680, \E4 you'll need a cool  mutant hand to count  all of your deaths. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_685,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_686,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  six times in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_687,  that's the number of  fingers on a mutant  hand. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_688, \E3 but soon... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_689, \E4 you'll need to find  a mutant hand with  even more fingers. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_694,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_695,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  seven times in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_696,  hey, that's good. seven's supposed to be  a lucky number. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_697,  who knows, maybe  you'll hit the  jackpot... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_698, \E4 and that number will  multiply tenfold. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_703,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_704,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  eight times in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_705,  that's the number of  fingers on a spider.

 obj_lastsans_trigger_714,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  seven times in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_715,  ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_716,  nope, wait, that's  definitely nine, sorry. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_717, \E4 or was it ten? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_723,  hmm. that expression... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_724,  that's the expression  of someone who's died  ten times in a row. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_725,  hey, congrats! the big one-oh!

 obj_lastsans_trigger_739,  don't think i'll be  able to count very  well from here. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_740,  count for me, ok? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_741, \E4 we'll start from 12. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_747,  let's just get to  the point. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_752,  ... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_753,  that expression that  you're wearing...

 obj_lastsans_trigger_755, \E4 well, i won't grace  it with a description. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_759,  ...

 obj_lastsans_trigger_786, \E3 heh heh heh heh... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_787,  all right. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_788, \E3 well, here's a better  question. 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_789, \E4 do you wanna have  a bad time? 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_790, \E3 'cause if you take  another step  forward... 
 obj_lastsans_trigger_791, \E4 you are REALLY not  going to like what  happens next.

 obj_mainend_475,  But she can get  through it! 
 obj_mainend_476,  I'm there supporting  her!!

 obj_mainend_545, \E4 S-sorry, I hate  talking on the  phone. 
 obj_mainend_546, \E3 I don't really know  what to say. 
 obj_mainend_547,  ... 
 obj_mainend_548, \E7 Hey, why didn't you  tell me the queen  was so cute? 
 obj_mainend_549, \E3 Uh, I mean, uh... 
 obj_mainend_550, \E6 Mettaton's doing OK! 
 obj_mainend_551,  And! Um! 
 obj_mainend_552, \E6 I'm trying to figure  a way for us to  get out of here! 
 obj_mainend_553, \E4 B-but I kinda have  no idea what I'm  doing. 
 obj_mainend_554,  I'll figure it out  eventually, though. 
 obj_mainend_555, \E3 The queen is a lot  different from  ASGORE... 
 obj_mainend_556, \E7 She actually checks to  see if I'm doing  anything. 
 obj_mainend_557,  She's really turned  this whole place  around! 
 obj_mainend_558,  ... 
 obj_mainend_559, \E3 Oh! Hey! Wait a second! 
 obj_mainend_560,  Hey! TORIEL! Do you wanna talk  to...? 
 obj_mainend_561,  ... 
 obj_mainend_562,  Well, she says she's  busy. 
 obj_mainend_564,  Oh, she SAYS she's  busy. 
 obj_mainend_566, IF SHE KNEW WHOWE WERE TALKINGTO... 
 obj_mainend_568,  we wouldn't get the  phone back for at  least a few hours. 
 obj_mainend_570, WE HAVE THEMERCY TO SPAREYOU FROM HER!! 
 obj_mainend_572,  B-but, if you want  to, call and talk  to her any time. 
 obj_mainend_574,  Yeah! She'd be happy to  hear from ya! 
 obj_mainend_576,  oh, whoops. 
 obj_mainend_577,  this thing's almost  outta batteries. 
 obj_mainend_578,  so, hate to cut this  short, but... 
 obj_mainend_579,  be seeing you, ok,  buddy? 
 obj_mainend_581, BYE BYE FOR NOW! 
 obj_mainend_583,  See ya, punk! 
 obj_mainend_585,  G-good... Good... 
 obj_mainend_586, \E4 Hey, why do I  have to be the one  to hang up? 
 obj_mainend_587, \E7 Eheheh... I hate goodbyes... 
 obj_mainend_588, \E3 Um, we'll see you  again someday! 
 obj_mainend_612,  Click... 
 obj_mainend_650,  so... it's been a while. 
 obj_mainend_651,  the queen returned, and  attempted to resume  ruling the underground. 
 obj_mainend_652,  she enstated a new  policy... 
 obj_mainend_653, \E3 all the humans who fall  here would be treated  not as enemies... 
 obj_mainend_654,  but as friends. 
 obj_mainend_655, \E3 ... 
 obj_mainend_656,  but people REALLY  didn't like that  policy. 
 obj_mainend_665,  because of you, not  only was the king  gone... 
 obj_mainend_666, \E3 but the human souls  had gone missing as  well... 
 obj_mainend_667,  along with the lives  of countless citizens. 
 obj_mainend_669,  along with the life  of... 
 obj_mainend_671,  along with the life  of undyne, their  greatest hero. 
 obj_mainend_673,  along with the lives  of countless citizens. 
 obj_mainend_674,  nobody wanted to see  that happen ever again. 
 obj_mainend_675,  so the people started  a rebellion to  overthrow the queen. 
 obj_mainend_676,  but, she, uh, pretty  much gave up peacefully  when she realized. 
 obj_mainend_677,  so she went back  to the ruins. 
 obj_mainend_678,  the underground's  basically an uneasy  anarchy now. 
 obj_mainend_679,  everyone's trying to  live life like they  always have... 
 obj_mainend_680, \E3 but it's not really  easy, you know? 
 obj_mainend_681,  when all of your  hope has pretty much  been thrown away... 
 obj_mainend_682,  ... 
 obj_mainend_688,  undyne spearheaded  the revolution, of  course. 
 obj_mainend_691, \E3 she was pretty mad  after what happened  to asgore. 
 obj_mainend_695, \E3 she was pretty mad  after what happened  to asgore and alphys. 
 obj_mainend_697,  she threw the queen  out of the castle  with her strength. 
 obj_mainend_698,  then she became the  empress of the  underground... 
 obj_mainend_699,  and banished the  queen back to the  ruins. 
 obj_mainend_700,  seems like undyne's... hmmm... 
 obj_mainend_701, \E3 even more vehement  about destroying  humanity than ASGORE. 
 obj_mainend_702,  ... 
 obj_mainend_716,  but hey! it's not all bad! 
 obj_mainend_717,  she's not so lonely  anymore. 
 obj_mainend_718,  me and papyrus go  and visit her... 
 obj_mainend_719,  we bring her books  from the library,  or play games... 
 obj_mainend_720,  we've even convinced  her to leave  sometimes. 
 obj_mainend_721,  as long as me or  papyrus stay behind  to watch for humans. 
 obj_mainend_722,  but papyrus loves  doing that. 
 obj_mainend_724, YEAH!!!I LOVE STANDING INFOR THE QUEEN!!! 
 obj_mainend_725, I'VE BEEN PRACTICINGFOR WHEN A HUMANCOMES. 
 obj_mainend_726, I'M GOING TO BEA GREAT MOM!!! 
 obj_mainend_727, \E3BY THE WAY,WHO ARE YOUTALKING TO? 
 obj_mainend_729,  oh, nobody. 
 obj_mainend_731, OH, COOL.TELL THEM I SAYHI!!! 
 obj_mainend_733,  papyrus says hi. 
 obj_mainend_734,  well, i hope things  are better where  you are. 
 obj_mainend_735,  later. 
 obj_mainend_740,  but hey! it's not all bad! 
 obj_mainend_741,  when the queen went  back to the ruins... 
 obj_mainend_742,  i decided to go  with her. 
 obj_mainend_743,  and i took out some  books from the  library, too. 
 obj_mainend_744,  so she won't have  to read the same  ones. 
 obj_mainend_745,  she's a good roomie. we have a lot of  fun. 
 obj_mainend_746,  ... 
 obj_mainend_747,  you know. 
 obj_mainend_748,  sometimes the queen  talks about... 
 obj_mainend_749,  how she'd like to  see you again. 
 obj_mainend_750,  isn't that nice? 
 obj_mainend_751, \E3 ... 
 obj_mainend_752, \E3 i don't have the  heart to tell her  what you did. 
 obj_mainend_753,  do you know how she'd  react? 
 obj_mainend_754, \E3 if i told her that  'cause she protected  you... 
 obj_mainend_755, \E4 ... you went on to  kill my brother...? 
 obj_mainend_756, \E3 ... 
 obj_mainend_757,  anyway, never come  back here. 
 obj_mainend_758,  you are not welcome. 
 obj_mainend_759,  later. 
 obj_mainend_784,  since you left,  things down here... 
 obj_mainend_785, \E3 are different. 
 obj_mainend_786,  with ASGORE gone... 
 obj_mainend_787,  undyne became the  ruler of the  underground. 
 obj_mainend_788, \E3 she's decided to  destroy every human  that comes here. 
 obj_mainend_789, \E3 and since the human  souls disappeared... 
 obj_mainend_790,  she's also looking  for a new way to  break the barrier... 
 obj_mainend_791,  and when she does,  she's going to wage  war on humanity. 
 obj_mainend_792,  i mean, that was  asgore's plan, too. 
 obj_mainend_793,  but he was really,  uh, bad at it. 
 obj_mainend_794,  undyne has also  expanded the royal  guard massively. 
 obj_mainend_795,  she says the first  thing she'll do after  we get out of here... 
 obj_mainend_796,  is take her army... 
 obj_mainend_797, \E3 and personally hunt  you down and destroy  you. 
 obj_mainend_801,  meanwhile... 
 obj_mainend_802,  i've been knocking  on the door to  the RUINs... 
 obj_mainend_803, \E3 but the woman that's  there hasn't been  answering me. 
 obj_mainend_804,  maybe she's not  feeling well? 
 obj_mainend_805, \E3 heh. 
 obj_mainend_806, \E4 or maybe she's not  feeling anything at  all...? 
 obj_mainend_807, \E4 you'd better watch  yourself, kid. 
 obj_mainend_808, \E4 things are lookin  real bad for you. 
 obj_mainend_813,  meanwhile... 
 obj_mainend_814, \E3 i've been knocking on  the door to the  RUINS... 
 obj_mainend_815, \E3 but that woman hasn't  been answering me... 
 obj_mainend_816,  maybe she's not  feeling well? 
 obj_mainend_818, HEY, SANS, WHO AREYOU TALKING TO?

 obj_mainend_877,  with ASGORE gone, the  people looked to  undyne to rule... 
 obj_mainend_878, \E3 but she was nowhere  to be found. 
 obj_mainend_879,  so mettaton just  kind of... took over? 
 obj_mainend_880,  he's brainwashed  everyone with his  stupid TV show. 
 obj_mainend_881,  and made the  underground into his  personal paradise. 
 obj_mainend_882, \E3 it's honestly... kinda disturbing. 
 obj_mainend_883,  as for me? oh, yeah...

 obj_mainend_984, \E3 so.. it's been a while. 
 obj_mainend_985,  since you left... 
 obj_mainend_986,  things have gotten  really strange. 
 obj_mainend_987,  overnight, a bunch of  people mysteriously  disappeared. 
 obj_mainend_988, \E3 as well as the  human souls. 
 obj_mainend_989, \E3 people were heart-  broken. everyone they  looked up to... 
 obj_mainend_990,  everything they were  relying on, in one  night, disappeared. 
 obj_mainend_991,  everyone clamored to  elect a new ruler as  fast as possible. 
 obj_mainend_992,  so, uh... by process of  elimination... 
 obj_mainend_993,  papyrus became the  ruler? 
 obj_mainend_994,  why doesn't he talk  to you about this... 
 obj_mainend_996, HELLO!!!HUMAN!!!

 obj_mainend_1014, \E3WE'VE DECIDED, UM. 
 obj_mainend_1015, SANS, WHAT WAS IT? 
 obj_mainend_1017,  we can't judge  humans to be all  good or all bad.

 obj_mainend_1044, THEN WE CAN ALLHANG OUT AGAIN!!! 
 obj_mainend_1045, NYEH HEH HEH!!! 
 obj_mainend_1055, \E3 it's been a while,  huh? 
 obj_mainend_1056,  ... 
 obj_mainend_1057,  things have gotten  pretty bad here. 
 obj_mainend_1058,  everyone considered a  leader disappeared  overnight. 
 obj_mainend_1059,  it's gotten so quiet. 
 obj_mainend_1060, \E3 there's a bad feeling  hanging over  everyone. 
 obj_mainend_1061,  like everyone's just  going to die here,  trapped in the dark... 
 obj_mainend_1062,  ... i bet you're  wondering why i'm  not the ruler. 
 obj_mainend_1063,  eh. 
 obj_mainend_1064,  i'm not cut out  for something like  that. 
 obj_mainend_1065,  i like to take it  easy, you know? 
 obj_mainend_1066,  ... 
 obj_mainend_1067, \E3 ... that's a joke. 
 obj_mainend_1068, \E3 this is what happens  when people like me  take it easy. 
 obj_mainend_1069,  ... 
 obj_mainend_1070, \E4 see ya. 
 obj_mainend_1074,  hey, at least things  are less crowded. 
 obj_mainend_1075,  'cause of all the  people you killed. 
 obj_mainend_1076,  hope that was a good  experience for you. 
 obj_mainend_1077, \E3 ... 
 obj_mainend_1078,  just kidding. i don't really hope  that. 
 obj_mainend_1079, \E4 go to hell. 
 obj_mainend_1092, \E3 it's been a while,  huh? 
 obj_mainend_1093,  ... 
 obj_mainend_1094,  it seems a number of  important people  disappeared overnight. 
 obj_mainend_1095,  but no one else was  harmed. 
 obj_mainend_1096,  the people were  confused. it was complete bedlam. 
 obj_mainend_1097, \E3 somehow, at the end of  the day... 
 obj_mainend_1098,  a small, white dog  became president of  the underground. 
 obj_mainend_1099,  it sleeps on the  throne and does  absolutely nothing. 
 obj_mainend_1100,  strangely, it seems  this is the best  life for everyone. 
 obj_mainend_1101,  thanks. 
 obj_mainend_1112, \E3 it's been a while,  huh? 
 obj_mainend_1113,  ... 
 obj_mainend_1114,  i'll be honest. 
 obj_mainend_1115,  i have no idea what  happened for you  to get here. 
 obj_mainend_1116,  this is actually some  sort of error-  handling message. 
 obj_mainend_1117, \E3 so, if you're getting  this ending... 
 obj_mainend_1118,  tell whoever made the  game, okay? 
 obj_mainend_1119,  they'll fix it, or  if it's a novel  situation... 
 obj_mainend_1120,  they might even add  another ending to  the game. 
 obj_mainend_1121, \E3 chances are, though... 
 obj_mainend_1122, \E4 you're just a dirty  hacker, aren't you? 
 obj_mainend_1123,  yeah, get outta here. 
 obj_mainend_1136,  H... hey. 
 obj_mainend_1137,  So... you're the one  who killed all my  friends. 
 obj_mainend_1139,  I just called to tell  you. 
 obj_mainend_1141,  I hate you. 
 obj_mainend_1143,  Yet... strangely... It's because of you,  that... 
 obj_mainend_1145,  That I was forced to  become a better  person. 
 obj_mainend_1147,  When I first saw you  hurting people... 
 obj_mainend_1148,  I just sat there. Watching you. 
 obj_mainend_1149,  I felt so guilty knowing  I hadn't do anything  to stop you. 
 obj_mainend_1150, \E3 I felt like all I  do was... 
 obj_mainend_1151, \E4 Was hope you would  destroy me, too. 
 obj_mainend_1152,  But when Undyne called,  with crazed desperation  in her voice... 
 obj_mainend_1153,  I... I realized I had to do  something. 
 obj_mainend_1154,  Even if it meant  everybody would... 
 obj_mainend_1155,  Have to learn the  truth about me. 
 obj_mainend_1156,  It's strange. You know? 
 obj_mainend_1157, \E5 Even after all the  bad things I did. 
 obj_mainend_1158,  People treated me like  a hero. 
 obj_mainend_1159,  And then they... Asked me to run  everything. 
 obj_mainend_1160, \E5 So I'm trying my  best, here. 
 obj_mainend_1161,  I think I have some  good policies, but,  y-you know... 
 obj_mainend_1162,  Talking to people  still makes me  nervous. 
 obj_mainend_1163,  I'm no ASGORE,  you know? 
 obj_mainend_1164,  ... 
 obj_mainend_1165, \E4 God... I miss everyone. 
 obj_mainend_1166, \E3 Now that they're  gone, it... 
 obj_mainend_1167,  It feels so clear what  I should have done. 
 obj_mainend_1168, \E3 What I should have  said. 
 obj_mainend_1169, \E6 Undyne... Asgore... 
 obj_mainend_1170,  Mettaton... 
 obj_mainend_1171, \E5 At least Sans is  still here. 
 obj_mainend_1172, \E4 He's... He's a good guy. And with him around... 
 obj_mainend_1173, \E4 I... 
 obj_mainend_1174,  Sigh. 
 obj_mainend_1175,  You know. Just daydreaming here. But... 
 obj_mainend_1176, \E5 I really should have  killed you when I  had the chance.

 obj_napstablook_farm2_404,  her best wasn't good  enough... 
 obj_napstablook_farm2_405,  oh.......... 
 obj_napstablook_farm2_408,  oh........ looks like you encouraged  your snail too much... 
 obj_napstablook_farm2_409,  all that pressure to  succeed... really got to her...

 obj_napstablook_farm2_415,  you won... congratulations. 
 obj_napstablook_farm2_416,  as a prize, you get 9G.

 obj_napstablook_farm2_422,  your snail lost by a  thin margin. 
 obj_napstablook_farm2_423,  actually, the snail is  under the false belief  that it won... 
 obj_napstablook_farm2_424,  oh no... the snail is looking  over here...

 obj_napstablookdate_193,  i can get you something  to eat... 
 obj_napstablookdate_312,  here we go... you'll lie down as long  as you don't move. 
 obj_napstablookdate_313,  so... only move around when  you want to get up, i  guess. 
 obj_napstablookdate_356,  well, that was nice... thank you... 
 obj_napstablookfriendtrigger_100,  oh hey... you... followed me... 
 obj_napstablookfriendtrigger_101,  my house is up here...

 obj_nicecreamguy_230,  If all humans are like you,  then...! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_231,  ... then I'll still be  able to sell to monsters,  I hope. 
 obj_nicecreamguy_234,  If all humans are like you,  I think it'll be a modest  success! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_236,  If all humans are like you,  I think it'll be really  popular! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_288,  OH!!!! A CUSTOMER!!! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_291,  Fortunately, I've thought  of a solution!! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_292,  Punch cards!! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_293,  Every time you buy a  Nice Cream, you can take a  punch card from the box. 
 obj_nicecreamguy_294,  If you have 3 cards, you  can trade them for a  free Nice Cream! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_295,  They're sure to get the  customers to come back! 
 obj_nicecreamguy_296,  Anyway... 
 obj_nicecreamguy_302,  I'm having a going out of  business sale. 
 obj_nicecreamguy_320,  You must have something better to do than read this message. 
 obj_nicesnowman_107,  Oh? About that piece I gave you? 
 obj_nicesnowman_108,  ... 
 obj_nicesnowman_109,  ... I never gave you anything. 
 obj_nicesnowman_120,  Ah... I can feel that piece  of me has been well taken  care of. 
 obj_nicesnowman_121,  Thank you. 
 obj_nicesnowman_122,  Hmmm...? The barrier's opened up? 
 obj_nicesnowman_123,  Hmmm... Then, if it's not too much  to ask... 
 obj_nicesnowman_124,  ... could you take that  piece of me to the surface? 
 obj_nicesnowman_125,  I would really appreciate  it. 
 obj_nicesnowman_133,  So, did you take that  piece of me very far  away...? 
 obj_nicesnowman_134,  ... 
 obj_nicesnowman_135,  Where's the piece!? 
 obj_nicesnowman_140,  Ah, the barrier's open...? 
 obj_nicesnowman_141,  You know I cannot move. Why are you telling me? To mock me? 
 obj_nicesnowman_142,  Everyone may think you are a  good person, but this snowman  knows the truth. 
 obj_nicesnowman_143,  Someday, your friends will  realize your heart is as  cold as my butt. 
 obj_nicesnowman_155,  You're carrying too many  items. 
 obj_nicesnowman_161,  Hello. I am a snowman. I cannot move. 
 obj_nicesnowman_162,  Traveller, if you could... 
 obj_nicesnowman_163,  You got the Snowman Piece. 
 obj_nicesnowman_167,  Oh me, oh my. What are you doing? 
 obj_nicesnowman_168,  Soon there won't be any  of me left... 
 obj_nicesnowman_169,  You got the Snowman Piece. 
 obj_nicesnowman_173,  Stop... Please... 
 obj_nicesnowman_174,  You got the Snowman Piece. 
 obj_nicesnowman_177,  A useless pile of snow.

 obj_npc_room_277,  It's a trophy. Number 1 Nose-Nuzzle  Champs '98! 
 obj_npc_room_282,  This is an Echo Flower. It repeats the last thing  it heard, over and over... 
 obj_npc_room_283,  Neat, huh? 
 obj_npc_room_284,  Never trust a flower... That's one of the constants  of this world. 
 obj_npc_room_291,  This cheese has been here so  long, a magical crystal has  grown around it. 
 obj_npc_room_292,  It's stuck to the table... 
 obj_npc_room_295,  Seems like the mouse has  freed some of the cheese  from the crystal somehow. 
 obj_npc_room_300,  What's a star? 
 obj_npc_room_301,  Can you touch it? 
 obj_npc_room_302,  Can you eat it? 
 obj_npc_room_303,  Can you kill it? 
 obj_npc_room_304,  ... 
 obj_npc_room_305,  Are you a star? 
 obj_npc_room_308,  What are you holding? Is that a star? 
 obj_npc_room_313,  We can go and see the  real stars now... 
 obj_npc_room_314,  But I still don't know  what those are. 
 obj_npc_room_319,  One of the stars faded out. 
 obj_npc_room_320,  What does that mean...? 
 obj_npc_room_334,  It's a dirty sock with a  series of notes on it. 
 obj_npc_room_335, \TP  
 obj_npc_room_336, SANS!PLEASE PICK UP YOUR SOCK!

 obj_npc_room_355, \TP  
 obj_npc_room_356, FORGET IT! 
 obj_npc_room_368,  What. What? WHAT!? 
 obj_npc_room_369,  It's a living. 
 obj_npc_room_372,  So, you helped get us  all free... 
 obj_npc_room_373,  I guess I really acted  like a dummy to you. 
 obj_npc_room_377,  Sorry for acting like a  dummy before. 
 obj_npc_room_378,  You've really helped me  out!! 
 obj_npc_room_384,  It's a snail. 
 obj_npc_room_385,  For some reason, you can't  help but wonder what it  tastes like... 
 obj_npc_room_388,  It's a snail. 
 obj_npc_room_389,  You wonder if Toriel has  seen it. 
 obj_npc_room_406,  We were hanging out  when suddenly, a buncha puzzles  reactivated out of nowhere. 
 obj_npc_room_407,  This is a huge problem... It rules! They've GOTTA  cancel school over this! 
 obj_npc_room_409,  Wait a second... Auuuugh, it's summer vacation! 
 obj_npc_room_417,  Hey, did you hear? The barrier's opened up! 
 obj_npc_room_418,  Now school HAS to be  cancelled, right!? 
 obj_npc_room_423,  Why should we bother going  to school, anyway...? 
 obj_npc_room_424,  This world's got no future. 
 obj_npc_room_430,  Finally! Someone turned off that laser! 
 obj_npc_room_431,  Now that we're free we can... Well, uh, I guess we'll just  keep standing here. 
 obj_npc_room_434,  Hm? Nice try, but your loitering  technique still needs work. 
 obj_npc_room_436,  There will be lots of places  to loiter on the surface,  I bet. 
 obj_npc_room_440,  Loitering around... What's the point? 
 obj_npc_room_451,  The way to work is blocked,  so I had time to catch  Mettaton's show on my phone... 
 obj_npc_room_452,  The special effects were  amazing today! That human almost looked REAL! 
 obj_npc_room_454,  Of course, an experienced  viewer like me knows CGI  when they see it... 
 obj_npc_room_458,  The barrier's opened up, so  we don't have to go to  work today. 
 obj_npc_room_459,  I mean, sure, we're free,  but it's the little  things, you know? 
 obj_npc_room_464,  That last episode had me  really shaken... 
 obj_npc_room_465,  But Mettaton's OK. Everyone knows it's just CGI! 
 obj_npc_room_470,  Mettaton? Yeah, he's the most popular  star in the underground! 
 obj_npc_room_471,  His fan club probably has  at least two... no, THREE  dozen members! 
 obj_npc_room_474,  And that's not even counting  me! 
 obj_npc_room_478,  Today, we all started as  co-workers... 
 obj_npc_room_479,  Who knows what we'll be  tomorrow? 
 obj_npc_room_484,  What a heartbreaker. 
 obj_npc_room_485,  I bet his fanclub's almost  doubled in size from that! 
 obj_npc_room_508,  There's a piece of cheese  inside this computerized  laser-safe. 
 obj_npc_room_509,  The lasers have melted the  edges of the cheese... It's stuck to the table. 
 obj_npc_room_513,  Seems like the mouse hacked  the safe and took the  cheese out. 
 obj_npc_room_523,  It's so nice to  have you over! 
 obj_npc_room_524,  Why not take a  seat at the  table? 
 obj_npc_room_527,  Sit at the freakin'  table, you little  nerd. 
 obj_npc_room_534,  I... I... I ended up buying a  donut... 
 obj_npc_room_535,  I... I... I didn't want to, but  that girl... even though I told  her no, she... 
 obj_npc_room_536,  ... kept staring at me in this  creepy way and licking her  lips. 
 obj_npc_room_537,  N... now I'm outta cash. 
 obj_npc_room_540,  Maybe I can sell it online  and double my money back... 
 obj_npc_room_545,  On the surface, I won't  buy any donuts from  spiders. 
 obj_npc_room_546,  That's my resolution. 
 obj_npc_room_551,  ... 
 obj_npc_room_568,  It's just a regular flower. 
 obj_npc_room_580,  ... 
 obj_npc_room_582,  ... what? 
 obj_npc_room_588,  It's an empty dog food  bowl. 
 obj_npc_room_593,  It's a treadmill. There's a message attached. 
 obj_npc_room_594,   + '' + the truth is that you got  owned, nerd...... + '' +  
 obj_npc_room_599,  ... he seems happy. 
 obj_npc_room_604,  Sn... ow... y... 
 obj_npc_room_615,  There you are,  Frisk-darling. 
 obj_npc_room_616, \E8 Feast your eyes! Dr. Alphys completed  my wonderful new body. 
 obj_npc_room_617, \E7 Oooh! And did you hear? The barrier's OPEN! 
 obj_npc_room_618, \E4 I can't wait to see  the sun... 
 obj_npc_room_619, \E5 ... the greatest  spotlight of all!! 
 obj_npc_room_620, \E9 Oh yes. I suppose I should thank  you, too, darling. 
 obj_npc_room_621,  Before fighting you,  I had... 
 obj_npc_room_622, \E4 Forgotten how fun it  was to perform with  others. 
 obj_npc_room_623, \E6 So I've been searching  for HOT TALENTS to fill  up my upcoming troupe. 
 obj_npc_room_624,  So far, Shyren's agreed  to be my back-up singer. 
 obj_npc_room_625,  And Bl... Napstablook, here, will  be my sound mixer! 
 obj_npc_room_626,  The three of us  performing together... 
 obj_npc_room_627, \E4 It really feels overdue,  doesn't it? 
 obj_npc_room_631,  Frisk, darling. Can you help me with  something? 
 obj_npc_room_632,  What kind of merchandise  do you think humans  would want to buy...? 
 obj_npc_room_633,  I've thought of a few  ideas so far. 
 obj_npc_room_634, \E6 Buttons with my face Stickers with my face CDs with my face 
 obj_npc_room_635, \E7 Posters with my face T-shirts with my face Underwear with my face 
 obj_npc_room_636, \E9 ... and plush dolls of  TORIEL. 
 obj_npc_room_638, \E8 But, you know. With my face instead  of hers. 
 obj_npc_room_640,  So what do you think? 
 obj_npc_room_641, \TS \F0 \T0  
 obj_npc_room_642,  ... 
 obj_npc_room_644,  A yes or no prompt was not  provided. 
 obj_npc_room_645, \TS \F8 \TM  
 obj_npc_room_646, \E9 Fabulous! I completely agree! 
 obj_npc_room_651,  Oh, Frisk. Why don't you go see  how Alphys is doing? 
 obj_npc_room_652,  Since the flash of light  she's been working hard  to set everything right. 
 obj_npc_room_653,  Ha-Ha. About time, huh? 
 obj_npc_room_662,  By barking with text-to-speech  on, the dog accidentally  programmed a whole game. 
 obj_npc_room_663,  Hmmm... seems fine. 
 obj_npc_room_669,  Blub blub... You'll have to reserve a  table to eat here. 
 obj_npc_room_670,  You'll also need to reserve  your chair, your silverware,  your food, your... 
 obj_npc_room_674,  Blub blub... Now we can live life  without reservations. 
 obj_npc_room_679,  Blub blub... Mettaton isn't here to press  his face into the steaks. 
 obj_npc_room_680,  He told me that if he ever  disappeared, we could use  my face instead... 
 obj_npc_room_681,  But, I'm nervous. What if my face doesn't  taste very good...? 
 obj_npc_room_686,  As I came in, I realized I  forgot to make a reservation. 
 obj_npc_room_687,  But I didn't want to look  like I messed up. So I kept walkin' in anyway. 
 obj_npc_room_688,  Now I'm just... kinda... Consuming dew off this ficus. 
 obj_npc_room_692,  Oh, we're all free? 
 obj_npc_room_693,  Oh... Guess I can... Stop lickin' this ficus. 
 obj_npc_room_694,  ... but I don't want to look  like I messed up, so  I'll keep going... 
 obj_npc_room_699,  What would Mettaton think if  he saw me licking this  plant of his...? 
 obj_npc_room_700,  Eh... who cares. 
 obj_npc_room_709,  I work at the CORE. The inside is a maze made of  swappable parts... 
 obj_npc_room_710,  That means we can shuffle the  layout at will. 
 obj_npc_room_711,  Boy, was today a FUN day! I sure love PUZZLE!!! 
 obj_npc_room_715,  So, if we're leaving, will  my job...? 
 obj_npc_room_716,  Ugh, and I just got a raise! Well, guess every apple has  its CORE, heheh. 
 obj_npc_room_721,  Today, we received the  promise of a lot of money  from a strange source. 
 obj_npc_room_722,  It may not be kosher, but... Whew! I love puzzle! 
 obj_npc_room_728,  Originally, we dug mazes  with puzzles in order to  foil human attacks. 
 obj_npc_room_729,  But now, building things  winding and confusing.... It's some awful tradition. 
 obj_npc_room_730,  You can't go ugh two feet  without being up to your  armpits in puzzles. 
 obj_npc_room_734,  The surface world... Really! 
 obj_npc_room_735,  Maybe I'll be able to  go two feet without running  into a puzzle. 
 obj_npc_room_740,  One thing I can say... 
 obj_npc_room_741,  I respect Mettaton for not  putting any puzzles here. 
 obj_npc_room_742,  At another hotel, I had  to find 12 magic keys just to  unlock the shower. 
 obj_npc_room_751,  Mettaton looked really... Really cool in that dress. 
 obj_npc_room_752,  It sort of makes me feel like  I could wear one, too! 
 obj_npc_room_756,  Mettaton...! He recognized my voice from  when I called in, and... 
 obj_npc_room_757,  He... he gave me his dress! I'm so...! Ha ha ha! 
 obj_npc_room_762,  Please don't talk to me. I am feeling discouraged  about something. 
 obj_npc_room_769,  Welcome to MTT Resort -  Hotland's biggest apartment-  building-turned-hotel! 
 obj_npc_room_770,  Whether you're here for a night  or still live here, MTT Resort  prides itself on a great stay! 
 obj_npc_room_771,  Just passing through...? Nice! MTT Resort prides itself on  being passed through! 
 obj_npc_room_775,  Sorry - the resort's shutting  down. 
 obj_npc_room_776,  But I think you'll find it's  still great to pass through! 
 obj_npc_room_781,  Welcome to MTT Resort! Have you seen Mettaton? 
 obj_npc_room_782,  He hasn't come by lately. I have a lot of respect for  that man. 
 obj_npc_room_783,  I had trouble getting a job  because I am so pointy and  angular. 
 obj_npc_room_784,  But, being a rectangle, he  understood my struggles. 
 obj_npc_room_792,  I love hot dogs! 
 obj_npc_room_793,  Hey... Isn't it weird there's  SNOW on that guy's roof? 
 obj_npc_room_794,  ... guess he's just too lazy  to clean it off. 
 obj_npc_room_798,  I love hot dogs! 
 obj_npc_room_799,  But the hot dog guy left... Even though all of his  stuff is still here. 
 obj_npc_room_800,  ... guess he's just too lazy  to clean it away. 
 obj_npc_room_805,  I wanted another hot dog. But the hot dog guy never  came back. 
 obj_npc_room_806,  Besides that? Today was fine. 
 obj_npc_room_807,  Count your blessings. Even if you don't get a  second hot dog. 
 obj_npc_room_812,  Toasty bun! 
 obj_npc_room_817,  It's hard-boiled. 
 obj_onionsan_event_181,  Hey... there... Noticed you were... Here... 
 obj_onionsan_event_182, \M1 I'm Onionsan! Onionsan, y'hear! 
 obj_onionsan_event_211, \M1 You're visiting Waterfall, huh! It's great here, huh! You love it, huh! 
 obj_onionsan_event_212, \M0 Yeah! Me too! It's my Big Favorite. 
 obj_onionsan_event_224, \M3 Even though, the water's  getting so shallow here... 
 obj_onionsan_event_225,  I, have to sit down all  the time, but... 
 obj_onionsan_event_226, \M1 He-hey! That's OK! It beats moving to the city! 
 obj_onionsan_event_227,  And living in a crowded  aquarium! 
 obj_onionsan_event_228, \M2 Like all my friends did! 
 obj_onionsan_event_241, \M3 And the aquarium's full,  a-anyway, so, even if I  wanted to, I... 
 obj_onionsan_event_242, \M1 That's okay though, y'hear! Undyne's gonna fix  everything, y'hear! 
 obj_onionsan_event_243,  I'm gonna get out of here  and live in the ocean! Y'hear! 
 obj_onionsan_event_256, \M2 Hey... there... That's the end of this room. 
 obj_onionsan_event_257,  I'll see you around! Have a good time! 
 obj_onionsan_event_258,  In Waterfalllllllllllllllll  lllllllllllll 
 obj_onionsan_event_312, \M1 Oh! Did y'hear!!! 
 obj_onionsan_event_313, \M1 ... 
 obj_onionsan_event_314, \M1 I got nothing else... To talk about... 
 obj_onionsan_event_317, \M2 I've been wondering when  we're all gonna go free. 
 obj_onionsan_event_318, \M3 S-since... if we did... How would I ever know? 
 obj_onionsan_event_319, \M1 Well, I'll keep my  tentacles out for you! Y'hear! 
 obj_onionsan_event_320,  As soon as I know I'll be  the first to tell you! Y'hear!! 
 obj_onionsan_event_337, \M0 It's gotta be any day now! 
 obj_operatingtable_64,  It's some kind of operating  table. 
 obj_operatingtable_65,  It's sticky... 
 obj_otherphonecall_100,  Ring... ring... 
 obj_otherphonecall_115,  U-uhhh... Oh my god, help... 
 obj_otherphonecall_116,  I'd like to order a... Um... A pizza...? 
 obj_otherphonecall_117,  With, uhh... The toppings are, uh... 
 obj_otherphonecall_118,  I have them copied, I'll  just paste them to you. 
 obj_otherphonecall_119, \T0  
 obj_otherphonecall_120,  Your phone is too old to  receive texts... 
 obj_otherphonecall_121,  It reads out loud, character-  by-character, an ASCII art  of an anime catgirl. 
 obj_otherphonecall_122, \TA ... 
 obj_otherphonecall_133,  Click... 
 obj_outsideworld_event_158,  welp. 
 obj_outsideworld_event_159,  someone's gotta keep  him from getting  into trouble. 
 obj_outsideworld_event_160,  see you guys. 
 obj_outsideworld_event_183,  Man, do I have  to do EVERYTHING? 
 obj_outsideworld_event_184, \E6 Papyrus, wait!!! 
 obj_outsideworld_event_219,  Hey, Undyne!! Wait up!! 
 obj_outsideworld_event_255,  Whoops. 
 obj_outsideworld_event_273,  Uh, should I do  something? 
 obj_outsideworld_event_275,  ... 
 obj_outsideworld_event_277,  Well, gotta go! 
 obj_outsideworld_event_309,  It seems that everyone  is quite eager to  set off. 
 obj_outsideworld_event_344,  What? 
 obj_outsideworld_event_345,  Frisk... 
 obj_outsideworld_event_346,  You really are a  funny child. 
 obj_outsideworld_event_347,  If you had said that  earlier, none of this  would have happened.

 obj_readable_room2_295,  Why did the humans attack? Indeed, it seemed that they  had nothing to fear.

 obj_sansb_954,  Just keep attacking. 
 obj_sansb_956,  Sans's movements grow a  little wearier. 
 obj_sansb_958,  Sans's movements seem to be  slower. 
 obj_sansb_960,  Felt like a turning point. 
 obj_sansb_962,  You felt your sins crawling  on your back. 
 obj_sansb_963,  You felt your sins weighing  on your neck. 
 obj_sansb_964,  KARMA coursing through your  veins. 
 obj_sansb_965,  Doomed to death of KARMA! 
 obj_sansb_969,  The REAL battle finally begins. 
 obj_sansb_971,  Reading this doesn't seem  like the best use of time. 
 obj_sansb_973,  Sans is starting to look  really tired. 
 obj_sansb_975,  Sans is preparing something. 
 obj_sansb_977,  Sans is getting ready to  use his special attack. 
 obj_sansb_985,  Sans is sparing you. 
 obj_sansb_1013,  SANS 1 ATK 1 DEF The easiest enemy. Can only deal 1 damage. 
 obj_sansb_1014,  Can't keep dodging forever. Keep attacking.^ 
 obj_sansb_1018,  SANS 1 ATK 1 DEF The easiest enemy. Can only deal 1 damage.^

 obj_sansb_body_2540, i'm going togrillby's. 
 obj_sansb_body_2574, papyrus, do youwant anything? 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_124,  actually, hey... hate to bother ya, but  can you do me a favor? 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_125,  i was thinking... my brother's been  kind of down lately... 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_126,  he's never seen a human  before. and seeing you  might just make his day. 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_127,  don't worry, he's not  dangerous. 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_128,  even if he tries to be. 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_129,  thanks a million. i'll be up ahead. 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_132,  well, i'll be straight-  forward with you. 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_133,  my brother'd really  like to see a human... 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_134,  so, y'know, it'd  really help me out... 
 obj_sansbyetrigger_135,  if you kept pretending  to be one. 
 obj_sanscheckpoint_98,  It's some sort of checkpoint  or sentry-station. 
 obj_sanscheckpoint_99,  But there are bottles of  ketchup, mustard, and relish  sitting inside... 
 obj_sansdate3_116,  well, here we are. 
 obj_sansdate3_124,  so. 
 obj_sansdate3_125,  your journey's  almost over, huh? 
 obj_sansdate3_126,  you must really  wanna go home. 
 obj_sansdate3_127,  hey. i know the feeling,  buddo. 
 obj_sansdate3_128,  though... 
 obj_sansdate3_129,  maybe sometimes it's  better to take what's  given to you. 
 obj_sansdate3_130,  down here you've  already got food,  drink, friends... 
 obj_sansdate3_131,  is what you have  to do... 
 obj_sansdate3_132,  really worth it? 
 obj_sansdate3_149,  ... 
 obj_sansdate3_150,  ah, forget it. 
 obj_sansdate3_151,  i'm rootin' for  ya, kid. 
 obj_sansdate3_168,  hey. 
 obj_sansdate3_169,  let me tell you  a story. 
 obj_sansdate3_170,  so i'm a sentry in  snowdin forest, right? 
 obj_sansdate3_171,  i sit out there  and watch for humans. it's kind of boring. 
 obj_sansdate3_172,  fortunately, deep in  the forest... 
 obj_sansdate3_173,  there's this HUGE  locked door. 
 obj_sansdate3_174,  and it's perfect  for practicing  knock knock jokes. 
 obj_sansdate3_175,  so one day, i'm  knocking 'em out,  like usual. 
 obj_sansdate3_176,  i knock on the  door and say   + '' + knock knock. + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_177,  and suddenly, from  the other side... 
 obj_sansdate3_178,  i hear a woman's  voice. 
 obj_sansdate3_179, \Tt  + '' + who is there? + '' +   
 obj_sansdate3_180, \Ts so, naturally, I  respond: 
 obj_sansdate3_181,   + '' + dishes. + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_182, \Tt  + '' + dishes who? + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_183, \Ts  + '' + dishes a very  bad joke. + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_184,  then she just  howls with laughter. 
 obj_sansdate3_185,  like it's the best  joke she's heard  in a hundred years. 
 obj_sansdate3_186,  so I keep 'em  coming, and she keeps  laughing. 
 obj_sansdate3_187,  she's the best  audience i've ever  had. 
 obj_sansdate3_188,  then, after a  dozen of 'em,  SHE knocks and says... 
 obj_sansdate3_189, \Tt  + '' + Knock knock! + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_190, \Ts i say  + '' + whos  there? + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_191, \Tt  + '' + old lady! + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_192, \Ts  + '' + old lady who? + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_193, \Tt  + '' + oh! I did not  know you could  yodel! + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_194, \Ts wow. 
 obj_sansdate3_195,  needless to say,  this woman was  extremely good. 
 obj_sansdate3_196,  we kept telling  each other jokes  for hours. 
 obj_sansdate3_197,  eventually, i had  to leave. 
 obj_sansdate3_198,  papyrus gets kind  of cranky without  his bedtime story. 
 obj_sansdate3_199,  but she told me  to come by again,  and so i did. 
 obj_sansdate3_200,  then i did again. and again. it's a thing now. 
 obj_sansdate3_201,  telling bad jokes  through the door. 
 obj_sansdate3_202,  it rules. 
 obj_sansdate3_221,  ... 
 obj_sansdate3_222,  one day, though, i  noticed she wasn't  laughing very much. 
 obj_sansdate3_223,  i asked her what  was up. 
 obj_sansdate3_224,  then she told me  something strange. 
 obj_sansdate3_225,  \Tt + '' + if a human ever  comes through this  door... + '' 
 obj_sansdate3_226,   + '' + ... could you please,  please promise  something? + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_227,   + '' + watch over them,  and protect them,  will you not? + '' +  
 obj_sansdate3_228, \Ts now, i hate making  promises. 
 obj_sansdate3_229,  and this woman,  i don't even know  her name. 
 obj_sansdate3_230, \E3 but... 
 obj_sansdate3_231,  someone who sincerely  likes bad jokes... 
 obj_sansdate3_232,  has an integrity  you can't say   + '' + no + '' +  to. 
 obj_sansdate3_259,  do you get what  i'm saying? 
 obj_sansdate3_260,  that promise i made  to her... 
 obj_sansdate3_261,  you know what would  have happened if she  hadn't said anything? 
 obj_sansdate3_262, \E3 ... buddy. 
 obj_sansdate3_279,  ... You'd be dead  where you stand. 
 obj_sansdate3_304, \E3 ... 
 obj_sansdate3_305,  hey, lighten up,  bucko! 
 obj_sansdate3_306,  i'm just joking  with you. 
 obj_sansdate3_307,  besides... 
 obj_sansdate3_308,  haven't i done a  great job protecting  you? 
 obj_sansdate3_309,  i mean, look at  yourself. 
 obj_sansdate3_310,  you haven't died  a single time. 
 obj_sansdate3_313,  that's right, isn't  it? 
 obj_sansdate3_314,  well, chalk it  up to my great  skills. 
 obj_sansdate3_317,  hey, what's that  look supposed to  mean? 
 obj_sansdate3_318,  am i wrong...? 
 obj_sansdate3_336,  heh. 
 obj_sansdate3_380,  well, that's all. 
 obj_sansdate3_381,  take care of  yourself, kid. 
 obj_sansdate3_382,  'cause someone really  cares about you. 
 obj_sansdoor_98,  The door is locked. 
 obj_sansdoor_102,  You unlock the door and  enter... 
 obj_sansmailbox_60,  It's a mailbox overflowing  with unread junk mail. 
 obj_sanssnowman_98,  It's a lump of snow with the  word 'sans' written on it  in red marker. 
 obj_sanssteps_56,  Seems like someone was  walking in circles just  to make noises... 
 obj_savepoint_97, \R \[1] left. 
 obj_savepoint_99, \R That comedian... 
 obj_savepoint_101,  Determination. 
 obj_savepoint_103,  The comedian got away. Failure. 
 obj_savepoint_118, \R \[1] left. 
 obj_savepoint_120,  Determination. 
 obj_savepoint_135, \R \[1] left. 
 obj_savepoint_137,  Determination.

 obj_savepoint_fake_268, FLOWEY the FLOWER! 
 obj_savepoint_fake_269, I owe you a HUGE thanks. 
 obj_savepoint_fake_270, \E9You really did a numberon that old fool. 
 obj_savepoint_fake_271, Without you, I NEVER couldhave gotten past him. 
 obj_savepoint_fake_272, \E7But now, with YOUR help...

 obj_shamblingmass_79,  As a slime, I'm saddened. 
 obj_shop1_263,  Take your time. 
 obj_shop1_264,  Hello, traveller. How can I help you? 
 obj_shop1_265,  But nobody came. 
 obj_shop1_352, What wouldyou liketo buy? 
 obj_shop1_353, \E5Thanks foryourpurchase. 
 obj_shop1_354, Justlooking? 
 obj_shop1_355, \E6That's notenoughmoney. 
 obj_shop1_356, \E6You'recarryingtoo much. 
 obj_shop1_357,  
 obj_shop1_438, Care tochat? 
 obj_shop1_476, \E3 Huh? Sell somethin'? Does this look like a  pawn shop? 
 obj_shop1_477, \E4 I don't know how it works where  you come from... but... 
 obj_shop1_478,  If I started spending money  on old branches and used  bandages, I'd be out of business  in a jiffy! 
 obj_shop1_480, \E4 If you're really hurtin' for  cash, then maybe you could  do some crowdfunding. 
 obj_shop1_481,  I hear people will pay for  ANYTHING nowadays. 
 obj_shop1_486,  You took 758G from behind the  counter. 
 obj_shop1_492,  Nothing left. 
 obj_shop1_498,  Bye now! Come again sometime! 
 obj_shop1_500,  ... 
 obj_shop1_504,  Hiya! Welcome to Snowdin! I can't remember the last  time I saw a fresh face around  here. 
 obj_shop1_505, \E4 Where did you come from? The capital? 
 obj_shop1_506,  You don't look like a tourist. Are you here by yourself? 
 obj_shop1_511,  I mean, it happened to you,  right? 
 obj_shop1_512,  There was a strange flash of  white light... Then I felt my body being pulled  into... something. 
 obj_shop1_513,  Then, suddenly, everything was  back to normal. 
 obj_shop1_518,  You want to know what to do  here in Snowdin? 
 obj_shop1_519, \E4 Grillby's has food, and the  library has information... 
 obj_shop1_520,  If you're tired, you can take  a nap at the inn. It's right next door - my sister  runs it. 
 obj_shop1_521,  And if you're bored, you can  sit outside and watch those wacky  skeletons do their thing. 
 obj_shop1_522,  There's two of 'em...\E4 Brothers, I think. They just showed up one day  and... ... asserted themselves. 
 obj_shop1_523,  The town has gotten a lot  more interesting since then. 
 obj_shop1_528,  I heard that it was all 'cause  a human came through here. 
 obj_shop1_529,  A human... I can hardly believe it! 
 obj_shop1_530,  Well if they decide to stop  in, I'll be sure to give  them a hero's welcome. 
 obj_shop1_536, \E4 Think back to your history  class... 
 obj_shop1_537,  A long time ago, monsters lived  in the RUINS back there in  the forest. 
 obj_shop1_538,  Long story short, we all decided  to leave the ruins and head  for the end of the caverns. 
 obj_shop1_539,  Along the way, some fuzzy folk  decided they liked the cold  and set up camp in Snowdin. 
 obj_shop1_540, \E6 Oh, and don't think about  trying to explore the RUINS... 
 obj_shop1_541,  The door's been locked for  ages. So unless you're a ghost  or can burrow under the door,  forget about it. 
 obj_shop1_545,  Didja hear? The RUINS have been opened up,  and get this... 
 obj_shop1_546,  They were opened from the  INSIDE. 
 obj_shop1_547,  Apparently the Queen had been  staying inside there for God  knows how long. 
 obj_shop1_548,  Pretty unbelievable, huh!? 
 obj_shop1_555,  Life is the same as usual. 
 obj_shop1_556,  A little claustrophobic... 
 obj_shop1_557,  But... we all know deep down  that freedom is coming, don't we? 
 obj_shop1_558,  As long as we got that hope, we  can grit our teeth and face the  same struggles, day after day... 
 obj_shop1_559, \E5 That's life, ain't it? 
 obj_shop1_563,  Well, I suppose I'll move  my store to the overworld... 
 obj_shop1_564,  ... haven't planned much  more than that, I'm afraid. 
 obj_shop1_570,  There's a note here. 
 obj_shop1_571,  Please don't hurt my family.

 obj_shop2_299, Don't youhaveenough? 
 obj_shop2_390, Anythingyouwannaknow? 
 obj_shop2_392, Really?YOUwannachat? 
 obj_shop2_438,  Ha!  I'm tryin' to get RID of  my junk, not get more of it! 
 obj_shop2_439, \E4 Though, I've heard if you  want to sell stuff, the Temmie  Village is your best bet. 
 obj_shop2_440,  Where is it? 
 obj_shop2_441, \E3 ... 
 obj_shop2_442,  I don't remember. 
 obj_shop2_444,  For the last time, I'm not  taking it! 
 obj_shop2_445,  I hear people will pay for  ANYTHING nowadays. 
 obj_shop2_448, \E3 I wouldn't buy your chitzy  garbage at knifepoint. 
 obj_shop2_454,  Be careful out there, kid! 
 obj_shop2_456,  Good riddance. 
 obj_shop2_462,  I've been around a long time.\E3 Maybe too long. 
 obj_shop2_463,  Studying history sure is  easy when you've lived through  so much of it yourself! Wa ha ha! 
 obj_shop2_468,  Long ago, ASGORE and I  agreed that escaping would  be pointless... 
 obj_shop2_469, \E3 Since once we left, humans  would just kill us. 
 obj_shop2_470,  I felt a little betrayed when  he eventually changed his  mind. 
 obj_shop2_471, \E4 But now, I think... Maybe he was right to. 
 obj_shop2_472,  'Cause after all, even though  we never escaped... 
 obj_shop2_473, \E3 A human's killing us anyway,  ain't that right? 
 obj_shop2_478,  OK, OK! I remember it clearly now. 
 obj_shop2_479, \E3 It was the monthly address at  the castle, and the queen  was giving her part on  current events. 
 obj_shop2_480,  After finishing her update,  she moved to pass the  microphone to the king. 
 obj_shop2_481, \E3 However, she didn't realize  the microphone was still in  her hands when she said: 
 obj_shop2_482,   + '' + Your turn, Fluffybuns. + '' +  
 obj_shop2_483,  The audience burst into  laughter. 
 obj_shop2_484,  Realizing what she had said,  she started laughing too. 
 obj_shop2_485,  After a few moments, the  king held up his arms. The crowd grew silent. 
 obj_shop2_486, \E3 He leaned towards the  microphone, expression... Stern. 
 obj_shop2_487,   + '' + Dear citizens. + '' +   + '' + Thank you for coming  here today. + '' +  
 obj_shop2_488, \E3  + '' + I... King Fluffybuns... + '' +  
 obj_shop2_489,  And the rest is history. 
 obj_shop2_497,  What's that? You want me to repeat myself? 
 obj_shop2_498,  Heck no! Your eyes still work... Go read a book or something! Wahaha! 
 obj_shop2_503,  Oh yeah... The prophecy. 
 obj_shop2_504, \E4 Legend has it, an 'angel' who has  seen the surface will descend  from above and bring us freedom. 
 obj_shop2_505, \E3 Lately, the people have been  taking a bleaker outlook... 
 obj_shop2_506, \E4 Callin' that winged circle the  'Angel of Death.' 
 obj_shop2_507, \E3 A harbinger of destruction,  waitin' to 'free' us from  this mortal realm... 
 obj_shop2_508,  In my opinion, when I see  that little circle... 
 obj_shop2_509,  I jus' think it looks neat! Wahaha! 
 obj_shop2_516,  That emblem actually predates  written history. The original meaning has been  lost to time... 
 obj_shop2_517, \E4 All we know is that the  triangles symbolize us monsters  below, and the winged circle  above symbolizes... 
 obj_shop2_518, \E3 Somethin' else. 
 obj_shop2_519,  Most people say it's the  'angel,' from the prophecy... 
 obj_shop2_524,  Eh? You don't know what that is? 
 obj_shop2_525,  What are they teaching you  kids in school nowadays...? Wa ha ha! 
 obj_shop2_526, \W That's the \YDelta Rune,\W the  emblem of our kingdom. The Kingdom... 
 obj_shop2_527,  ... of Monsters. 
 obj_shop2_528,  Wahaha! Great name, huh? It's as I always say... 
 obj_shop2_529,  Ol' King Fluffybuns can't name  for beans! 
 obj_shop2_537, \E3 Eh? Goat? 
 obj_shop2_538,  Actually, that reminds me. Toriel once wore a flower-  patterned muu-muu...  
 obj_shop2_539,  Folks kept saying  + '' + nice muu-  muu + '' +  to her, but she kept  thinking they were calling  her a cow. 
 obj_shop2_540,  So she never wore it again. 
 obj_shop2_541, \E3 What was the question again? 
 obj_shop2_542,  Oh. Right. ASGORE. 
 obj_shop2_543, \E3 He's a real interesting  type of monster. The strongest type of all. 
 obj_shop2_544,  We call 'em Boss Monsters. 
 obj_shop2_545,  When they have an offspring,  the SOUL power of the  parents flows into the  child... 
 obj_shop2_546,  Causing the child to grow  as the parents age. 
 obj_shop2_547, \E3 But ASGORE doesn't have a  child. So he's been stuck at the  same age... And probably will be forever. 
 obj_shop2_548,  Huh? What if the child is a  human...? What? 
 obj_shop2_549,  Nah. That wouldn't work. So if ASGORE's your father,  he'll definitely outlive  you. 
 obj_shop2_555,  I've lived too long to  be afraid of something  like you. 
 obj_shop2_556,  Try it, kiddo! 
 obj_shop2_557, \E3 ... I know you can't here. 
 obj_shop2_558,  Wah ha... Knowledge like that is  the only reason I've  survived so long. 
 obj_shop2_564,  King Fluffybuns? He's a friendly, happy-go-lucky  kind of guy... 
 obj_shop2_565, \E4 If you keep walking around long  enough, you'll probably meet him. He loves to walk around and  talk to people. 
 obj_shop2_566, \E3 Eh? Why do I call Dreemurr  'Fluffybuns?' Oh, that's a great story! 
 obj_shop2_567, \E3 ... 
 obj_shop2_568,  I don't remember it. 
 obj_shop2_569,  But if you come back much  later, I'm sure I'll have  remembered by then. 
 obj_shop2_573,  Oh yeah! Of course. Toriel was queen, and  Asgore was the king. 
 obj_shop2_574, \E3 It was tragic when she left. 
 obj_shop2_575,  Since everyone knew she was  really the brains behind the  throne... 
 obj_shop2_576,  But it was also just a  teensy, teensy bit relieving,  you know? 
 obj_shop2_577, \E3 Those two were really  insufferable together... Nuzzling noses, bein' all cute  n' cuddly in public... Embarrassing their children... 
 obj_shop2_578,  They were so sweet it  made me SICK. Thank god those days are  over! 
 obj_shop2_584, \E3 Eh? Fight you? 
 obj_shop2_585,  Nah... I'm not a hero. Never was. 
 obj_shop2_586,  And b'sides... These old bones aren't fit  for fighting anyhoo. 
 obj_shop2_587, \E3 One attack from you, and  then I'd... well... 
 obj_shop2_588,  At least by talking to  you, I've bought enough time  for some of them to escape. 
 obj_shop2_595,  Undyne? Yeah, she's a local hero  around here. 
 obj_shop2_596, \E4 Through grit and determination  alone, she fought her way to  the top of the Royal Guard. 
 obj_shop2_597, \E3 Actually, she just came through  here asking about someone who  looked just like you... 
 obj_shop2_598,  I'd watch your back, kid. And buy some items... It might just save your hide! Wa ha ha! 
 obj_shop2_601,  Undyne. She's really come a long way  since she was a little  urchin. 
 obj_shop2_602,  I used to be a hero myself,  back in the old days. Gerson, the Hammer of Justice. 
 obj_shop2_603, \E3 When she was younger, Undyne  would follow me around, to  watch me beat up bad guys... 
 obj_shop2_604,  Sometimes she'd even try  to help! 
 obj_shop2_605, \E3 Though, most of the time  the folks she attacked weren't  bad guys. It'd be the mailman or  something like that. 
 obj_shop2_606,  Anyhoo, I appreciated it! Wah ha ha ha!!! 
 obj_shop2_612,  I'm not a hero. 
 obj_shop2_613, \E3 But I know there's someone  out there. 
 obj_shop2_614,  Someone who'll never give  up trying to do the  right thing, no matter  what. 
 obj_shop2_615, \E4 There's no prophecy or  legend 'bout anyone like  that. 
 obj_shop2_616, \E3 It's just something I know  is true. 
 obj_shop2_617,  That someone like that  will strike you down. 
 obj_shop3_357,  Don't be shy now. 
 obj_shop3_358,  Hey! Check it  out! 
 obj_shop3_359,  But, like. 
 obj_shop3_362,  Yeah! Check it  out!

 obj_shop3_650,  Thanks, but we,  like, don't  really need  anything. 
 obj_shop3_658, \M2 Oh my God. Is that a  glamburger? 
 obj_shop3_668,  Stole 5G  from the  till. 
 obj_shop3_673,  The till  is empty.

 obj_shop3_685,  Like, later  and stuff! 
 obj_shop3_690,  ... 
 obj_shop3_692,  ... 
 obj_shop3_710,  I'm Bratty, and  this is my  best friend,  Catty. 
 obj_shop3_713,  I'm Catty, and  this is my  best friend,  Bratty. 
 obj_shop3_726, \M3 Well, that kind  of guy... 
 obj_shop3_727, \M5 You hang out  with him once,  then he wants  to hang out... 
 obj_shop3_728, \M2 All. The. Time. 
 obj_shop3_736, \M5 Oh, uh... 
 obj_shop3_745, \M4 OK, like,  the annoying  thing is... 
 obj_shop3_754, \M2 Oh, that guy  from the  store?\M4 Yuck, what a  creep. 
 obj_shop3_763, \M0 So, we're  like,  totally  free now,  huh? 
 obj_shop3_778,  Where do we  get the  garbage? 
 obj_shop3_779, \M4 Like, the  garbage store,  duh!!! 
 obj_shop3_788,  I mean, like,  where does  anyone get guns,  or food, or... 
 obj_shop3_798,  The stuff  inside, is  like... 
 obj_shop3_807, \M2 Oh, oops,  really? 
 obj_shop3_808, \M3 Uh, well,  when we  said, um... 
 obj_shop3_809,  We were  hyped for the  destruction  of humanity... 
 obj_shop3_810,  We were,  just, like,  joking, you  know? 
 obj_shop3_822,  So, like,  Dr. Alphys  built Mettaton,  right? 
 obj_shop3_829, \M6 Oh my God. Mettaton. 
 obj_shop3_830, \M6 He's like... My robot  husband.           
 obj_shop3_831, \M4 I think we're  like... both  going to marry  him. 
 obj_shop3_833,  Oh my GOD, METTATON. 
 obj_shop3_834,  Actually he's  like... MY robot  husband. 
 obj_shop3_835,  We're both  like, ALREADY  married to  him. 
 obj_shop3_836, \E6 He just, like,  doesn't know  it yet. 
 obj_shop3_845,  Hmmm... Now that  we're  gonna be  free... 
 obj_shop3_859, \M5 Oh my God. Alphys. 
 obj_shop3_860, \M0 She used to  live on our  street. 
 obj_shop3_862, \E7 Oh my god, ALPHYS. 
 obj_shop3_863,  She was like  a big sister. 
 obj_shop3_870, \M0 So Alphys  has always,  like... 
 obj_shop3_879, \M4 Oh my God. He's a total  goober. 
 obj_shop3_880, \M0 Like, I LOVE  that guy. 
 obj_shop3_881, \M5 God, we're  like... 
 obj_shop3_882, \M1 SO hyped for  the destruction  of humanity. 
 obj_shop3_884,  He's a big,  fuzzy  goofball!!    
 obj_shop3_885,  He's like,  SO nice.   
 obj_shop3_886, \E7 God, we're  like... 
 obj_shop3_887,  SO hyped for  the destruction  of humanity. 
 obj_shop3_898, \M0 Me? Yeah, I  LOVE cats! 
 obj_shop3_899, \M1 They're,  like,  SO tasty!! 
 obj_shop3_901, \E8 Me? Yeah, I  LOVE cats! 
 obj_shop3_902,  They're,  like,  SO cute!!! 
 obj_shop3_910,  Hey, this is  Bratty! 
 obj_shop3_912,  Hey, this is  Catty! 
 obj_shop3_959, \E3 TOTALLY wicked  expensive. 
 obj_shop3_970,  But, like, this  stuff we found  is like... 
 obj_shop3_980, \E3 TOTALLY wicked  cheap. 
 obj_shop3_991, \M5 You should... 
 obj_shop3_992, \M1 TOTALLY wicked  buy all of  it? 
 obj_shop3_994, \E7 Like...       
 obj_shop3_995, \E4 TOTALLY wicked  buy all of  it? 
 obj_shop3_1014,  We found it in  the garbage! 
 obj_shop3_1033, \M3 It's GOOD  garbage. 
 obj_shop3_1035, \E4 It's like,  really good  garbage. 
 obj_shop3_1055, \M5 ..... 
 obj_shop3_1056, \M1 Waterfall  mostly. 
 obj_shop3_1058, \E7 ..... 
 obj_shop3_1059,  I found a gun  in a dumpster! 
 obj_shop3_1071, \E6 That's like,  what they  TELL you. 
 obj_shop3_1082, \M2 But like... Mettaton always  acts like... 
 obj_shop3_1093, \E5 ... being built  was HIS  idea somehow. 
 obj_shop3_1104, \M5 And even right  after he was  built... 
 obj_shop3_1115, \E7 ... he acted  like Alphys was  an old friend. 
 obj_shop3_1126, \M4 But they're  like... Not friends  anymore. 
 obj_shop3_1137,  Yeah!!! Unlike me  and Bratty!! Best friends  for-EVER!!! 
 obj_shop3_1156, \M4 I mean, like,  if your big  sister... 
 obj_shop3_1167,  Takes you on  trips to the  dump. 
 obj_shop3_1179, \M0 She showed us  the coolest  places to  find trash. 
 obj_shop3_1189, \E7 She was always  collecting  these weird  cartoons. 
 obj_shop3_1201, \M5 Then she  became the  Royal  Scientist... 
 obj_shop3_1211, \E5 Yeah, we  haven't seen  her in  forever... 
 obj_shop3_1231,  Thought ASGORE  is a SUPER  cutie. 
 obj_shop3_1243, \M4 So, like, I'm  pretty sure  she... 
 obj_shop3_1253,  Made Mettaton  to, like,  totally  impress him. 
 obj_shop3_1265, \M2 A robot with a  SOUL... 
 obj_shop3_1275, \E5 That's, like,  SUPER relevant  to his hobbies! 
 obj_shop3_1288, \M0 So after seeing  Mettaton,  ASGORE... 
 obj_shop3_1298,  Asked her to do  all this science  stuff for him! 
 obj_shop3_1299, \E5 But nobody's,  like, seen  anything from  her yet. 
 obj_shop3_1319, \M2 Or...  her at all... 
 obj_shop3_1329,  She must,  like, just  stay in her  lab all day. 
 obj_shop3_1341, \M4 Like, live  a little,  girl. 
 obj_shop3_1351,  Yeah!!! Like us!!! 
 obj_shop3_1371, \E4 Oh my god,  can you go  get us some  Glamburgers? 
 obj_shop3_1383, \M0 We don't. Really need. Anything. 
 obj_shop3_1395,  Wait! I'll pay  you 1000G if  you get Mettaton  to autograph  my butt! 
 obj_shop3_1415, \E4 OH MY GOD!!! GIMME!!! 
 obj_shop3_1427, \M4 God, Catty. Try to have  some  self-control. 
 obj_shop3_1439, \E5 Sorry... 
 obj_shop3_1451, \M6 'Cause they  OBVIOUSLY  brought that  Glamburger  for ME. 
 obj_shop3_1463,  NOOO WAYYY!!!!! 
 obj_shop3_1484, \E5 Yeah! He's  a creep! 
 obj_shop3_1495, \E7 But he's kind  of cute,  too... 
 obj_shop3_1504, \M4 C'mon,  Catty, don't  you have  ANY  standards? 
 obj_shop3_1517, \M1 Nope!!! 
 obj_shop3_1537, \E7 He'd be OK  if he just  treated us  with some  respect. 
 obj_shop3_1549, \M5 But he just  acts... Really  weird. 
 obj_shop3_1561, \E5 And then acts  like it's OUR  fault he  acts that  way! 
 obj_shop3_1573, \M0 Like, when  we asked him  to get those  Glamburgers... 
 obj_shop3_1586,  He dropped them  and ran away  before we  could even say  anything! 
 obj_shop3_1598, \M3 We were,  like, going  to share  them. 
 obj_shop3_1610, \E7 Really? I wasn't. 
 obj_shop3_1624, \M1 Catty!! 
 obj_shop3_1644, \M2 Yeah!! He should come  look for  junk with us! 
 obj_shop3_1657, \M3 But like, if  we let him  hang out with  us... I just  worry it'll... 
 obj_shop3_1669, \E4\M2 ... be really  super fun! 
 obj_shop3_1682, \M1 Um, that was  NOT what I  was gonna say. 
 obj_shop3_1694,  But I was  close, right!? 
 obj_shop3_1707, \E7 But don't you  feel bad for  him, Bratty? 
 obj_shop3_1708, \E5 Poor  Burgerpants... 
 obj_shop3_1709, \E4 Think about how  cool we are  compared to  him!!! 
 obj_shop3_1710,  We'd be saving  his LIFE with  our  friendship!! 
 obj_shop3_1711,  His LIFE,  Bratty!! 
 obj_shop3_1724, \M4 Uh, so? 
 obj_shop3_1735, \E7 ..^5.  
 obj_shop3_1736,  Think of all  the glamburgers  he could get  for us!! 
 obj_shop3_1749, \M3 ... so is he  free after  work? 
 obj_shop3_1761,  Yeah, like,  totally  free. 
 obj_shop3_1773,  Like... Cool. 
 obj_shop3_1785,  Yeah, like,  cool. 
 obj_shop3_1797,  Like,  millennia  of being  imprisoned  finally over? 
 obj_shop3_1809,  Yeah, that's  like pretty  chill I guess. 
 obj_shop3_1822, \E7 Did we say  that? 
 obj_shop3_1834, \M4 Probably? 
 obj_shop3_1835, \M1 It's, like,  practically  our  catchphrase. 
 obj_shop3_1847, \E8 Really? I thought our  catchphrase  was... 
 obj_shop3_1848, \E4 B-B-Bratty's  the best,  C-C-Catty's  the coolest! 
 obj_shop3_1861, \M1 Um, no? 
 obj_shop3_1862,  We've like  literally  NEVER said  that. 
 obj_shop3_1873,  CAN it be  though!? CAN it be!? 
 obj_shop3_1886, \E4 OMG, we  can finally  fulfill our  DREAM of having  a pet cat! 
 obj_shop3_1899, \M1 That's, like,  YOUR dream,  Catty. 
 obj_shop3_1910,  But Bratty... 
 obj_shop3_1911, \E5\M5 I don't wanna  have a dream  without YOU  in it...! 
 obj_shop3_1924,  Aww... Catty..^3. 
 obj_shop3_1936,  And, in my  dream, YOU clean  up after  the cat! 
 obj_shop3_1949, \M1 Catty!!! 
 obj_shop3_1974, \E5 Bratty  NOOOO!!! 
 obj_shop3_1987, \M1 I'm just  kidding!! 
 obj_shop3_1988, \M4\E8 Kind of. 
 obj_shop3_1989, \M5\E7 Anyway, when  was the last  time you even  SAW a cat  around here? 
 obj_shop3_2001, \E8 Oh!! JUST the other  day! 
 obj_shop3_2002, \E3 There was  this CUTE  little white  cat walking  around... 
 obj_shop3_2003, \E4 It was, like,  SOOOOOO  clueless  looking. 
 obj_shop3_2004,  I pet it  for like an  hour!! 
 obj_shop3_2017, \M5 ..... ..... ... Catty. 
 obj_shop3_2028, \E7 Yeah, Bratty? 
 obj_shop3_2042, \M1 I think that  was, like... A dog^3. 
 obj_shop3_2053,  DOGS ARE JUST  FIRM CATS!!!! 
 obj_shop3_2067,  If you're  reading  this... 
 obj_shop3_2077, \E7 Then, like,  bad news you  mega-evil  weirdo! 
 obj_shop3_2088,  Alphys just  came here  and she's  taking us... 
 obj_shop3_2098, \E7 Someplace  super duper  safe! 
 obj_shop3_2109,  But, first,  we gotta use  up these gel  pens. 
 obj_shop3_2119, \E7 Yeah! Chill, Alphys! We don't wanna  waste pens! 
 obj_shop3_2131,  And don't even  THINK about  stealing our  stuff. 
 obj_shop3_2141,  Yeah, creep! Leave our  junk alone! 
 obj_shop3_2152,  Catty, it's  not JUNK. It's really  valuable. 
 obj_shop3_2162,  Yeah! Our garbage  is REALLY  valuable!

 obj_shop4_521, \E3 WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE. 
 obj_shop4_525, \E6 Hmmm... Why not try selling that to  the two chicks in the alley? 
 obj_shop4_529, \E3 Ah. Yes. I really want to buy your  weird dusty artifacts... NOT. 
 obj_shop4_535,  Have a SPARKULAR day! 
 obj_shop4_538, \E6 Any time, little buddy. 
 obj_shop4_539, \E6 Alone again... 
 obj_shop4_545, \E6 I'm getting on in years, so  let me give you some  advice, little buddy. 
 obj_shop4_546, \E3 You've still got time. Don't live like me. 
 obj_shop4_547, \E6 I'm 19 years old and I've  already wasted my entire life. 
 obj_shop4_551,  So we're free, huh? Mettaton told us as much. 
 obj_shop4_552, \E4 Then he told me,  + '' + don't  think that means you're  getting out of work early. + '' +  
 obj_shop4_553, \E6 Ah... my boss. I love that guy. 
 obj_shop4_554, \E3 And by that I mean I hate  him so, so much. 
 obj_shop4_559,  Evacuation? You're yanking my chain,  little weirdo. 
 obj_shop4_560, \E3 So WHAT if everybody else  left work? So WHAT if nobody's buying  anything? 
 obj_shop4_561, \E6 Par for the course,  little weirdo. Par for the course. 
 obj_shop4_566,  I'm a goofy goober Yeah   this errorr. message. 
 obj_shop4_570, \E6 Thank you, little buddy. 
 obj_shop4_575, \E5 They wanna hang out after  work? 
 obj_shop4_576, \E3 Ha! Ahahaha!! Yes!!! I won't let you down!! 
 obj_shop4_577, \E6 Little buddy... thank you. 
 obj_shop4_578,  You've brought a tear to the  eye of this old man. 
 obj_shop4_579, \E5 So, uh, where do they  want to go? 
 obj_shop4_580, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_581,  They want to hang out at  the garbage dump. 
 obj_shop4_582,  ... 
 obj_shop4_583, \E6 Well, nowhere to go but  up, right, little buddy? 
 obj_shop4_588, \E6 Hey little buddy, wanna help  me pick a spicy outfit for  my little shindig later? 
 obj_shop4_589, \E4 Though, now that I think  about it, I had to throw away  all of my clothes to make  room for the outfits Mettaton  gave me... 
 obj_shop4_590, \E5 Don't take it the wrong way. They're just all these... 
 obj_shop4_591, \E4 Weird getups. 
 obj_shop4_592,   + '' + Promotional + '' +  costumes. For  + '' + holidays. + '' +  Or  + '' + specials. + '' +  Or  + '' + because he felt like it. + '' +  
 obj_shop4_593, \E3 The thing IS though! Most of the time I'm the  only employee who has to  wear this stuff! 
 obj_shop4_594, \E3 Sometimes he even calls me  into his office just to... Make me put something on... 
 obj_shop4_595, \E4 Then he laughs and lets me  go back to work as normal. 
 obj_shop4_596, \E6 Anyways, I won't sweat it,  little buddy. I'll take it casual. 
 obj_shop4_597,  NEVER let hot people think  you care. That's how they GET you. 
 obj_shop4_603, \E5 Well? Don't keep me waiting,  little buddy!! 
 obj_shop4_608, \E4 The girls were... Talking about me...? 
 obj_shop4_609,  They say I should stop acting  like they owe me... 
 obj_shop4_610, \E5 ... and if I want to be  FRIENDS with them, I should  just... uh, try to see  things from their  perspective? 
 obj_shop4_611, \E4 Wow. 
 obj_shop4_612, \E6 Poor, naive little buddy. They've brainwashed you. 
 obj_shop4_613,   + '' + Friendship + '' +  is just a hot  person's way of making you  their slave. 
 obj_shop4_614, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_615, \E5 So, uh, what time would  they wanna hang out? 
 obj_shop4_620, \E5 Huh? Yeah, those two vendors in back. The girls. 
 obj_shop4_621, \E3 NOT the Nice Cream guy. 
 obj_shop4_622, \E5 He keeps coming in here and  asking me stuff like,  + '' + Hey Burgy, what do you think  of this joke for my next  ice cream wrapper? + '' +  
 obj_shop4_623, \E4 Joke? Why are you calling it a JOKE? 
 obj_shop4_624, \E3 You drew a picture of two  dudes hugging and wrote   + '' + I love hugs! + '' +  on it. 
 obj_shop4_625, \E3 You somehow understand comedy  EVEN LESS than that guy who  keeps going on stage and  crying about his family. 
 obj_shop4_626, \E5 Anyway, I, uh, just tell him  that they're good, because he  gives me the nice cream for  free afterward... 
 obj_shop4_631, \E4 Everyone calls me burgerpants  now. 
 obj_shop4_632, \E5 But you won't, will you,  little buddy? 
 obj_shop4_638, \E6 So I went out to the alley  to see those two ladies, and  uh... you know, see what'd  happen next. 
 obj_shop4_639, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_640, \E5 Then my boss, uh, saw me and  asked me what I was doing. 
 obj_shop4_641,  I was so startled, the hamburgers  in my pockets tumbled out  onto the ground. 
 obj_shop4_642, \E3 Not wanting to lose face,  I scrambled to pick them up! 
 obj_shop4_643, \E3 But, as I was leaning over,  the weight of the remaining  hamburgers... 
 obj_shop4_644, \E5 ... caused my pants to fall  down. 
 obj_shop4_645, \E4 Then the girls laughed at me. 
 obj_shop4_646, \E4 Everyone calls me Burgerpants  now. 
 obj_shop4_647,  
 obj_shop4_651, \E6 Listen. I like you, little buddy. So I'm gonna save you a lot  of trouble. 
 obj_shop4_652, \E3 Never interact with attractive  people. 
 obj_shop4_653, \E6 Unless you're  + '' + one of them, + '' +   they're just gonna take  advantage of you. 
 obj_shop4_654, \E3 Like that time those two  chicks asked me to sneak them  some glamburgers. 
 obj_shop4_655, \E6 And I, naive teenager that  I was, said yes to them. 
 obj_shop4_656, \E4 Bad idea. 
 obj_shop4_662, \E4 Those girls? The ones who saw my pants  fall down? 
 obj_shop4_663, \E5 Well, we're all gonna be  free, so I'll never see  them again, at least! 
 obj_shop4_667, \E4 So we're free now. 
 obj_shop4_668, \E5 Does that mean my double-  date is cancelled...? 
 obj_shop4_669, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_670, \E5 I know, it wasn't really  a... A date. 
 obj_shop4_671, \E6 Here's a trick, little buddy: Lie to yourself all the time. It makes you feel better. 
 obj_shop4_678, \E4 Well, Mettaton didn't tell me  I HAD to work, I guess... 
 obj_shop4_679, \E3 But that's the thing! Sometimes he doesn't even  call me into work until  halfway into my shift! 
 obj_shop4_680, \E4 If I don't play it safe,  he's going to yell at me. 
 obj_shop4_681, \E6 Okay, maybe  + '' + yell + '' +  is the  wrong term. 
 obj_shop4_682, \E4 It's more like he has this... CD album he plays... 
 obj_shop4_683, \E5 That's entirely full of  songs about how bad I am  at my job. 
 obj_shop4_698, \E5 Let's not talk about this. 
 obj_shop4_704,  Why do people find him so  attractive?? 
 obj_shop4_705, \E3 He's literally just a freaking  rectangle. 
 obj_shop4_706, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_707,  You know, one time, I bought  one of those, uh, kits  online... to... 
 obj_shop4_708, \E5 Uh, make yourself more  rectangular. 
 obj_shop4_709, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_710, \E5 They don't work. 
 obj_shop4_716, \E3 God, have you even looked  around? This place is a labyrinth of  bad choices. 
 obj_shop4_717,  And every time we try to change  something for the better, he  vetoes it and says  + '' + that's not  how they do it on the  surface. + '' +  
 obj_shop4_718, Oh! Right! 
 obj_shop4_719, \E3 Humans are always eating  hamburgers made of SEQUINS  AND GLUE. 
 obj_shop4_724, \E5 When I first came to Hotland,  it was my dream to work  with Mettaton. 
 obj_shop4_725, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_726, \E3 Well, be careful what you  wish for, little buddy! 
 obj_shop4_734, \E3 Don't tell anyone this, Little  Buddy. 
 obj_shop4_735, \E4 Because they'll make fun  of me, 
 obj_shop4_736, \E5 But I... I feel like I played a hand in  everyone getting free  somehow. 
 obj_shop4_737,  Even if it was just  working this awful job... 
 obj_shop4_738, \E5 I think I did something! 
 obj_shop4_739, \E3 I don't know if it's true,  but I'll believe it anyway! 
 obj_shop4_744, \E3 Huh? Everyone else is DEAD? 
 obj_shop4_745, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_746, \E5 Does that mean I don't  have to work today? 
 obj_shop4_747, \E6 God. That it were true,  little weirdo. That it were true. 
 obj_shop4_756, \E3 Future? WHAT future? Nothing down here EVER  changes. 
 obj_shop4_757, \E4 I'll probably be trapped  at this stupid job forever. 
 obj_shop4_758,  ... 
 obj_shop4_759, \E3 But wait! There's one thing that keeps  me going! 
 obj_shop4_760,  If ASGORE gets just one  more SOUL, we'll finally get  to go to the surface! 
 obj_shop4_761,  It'll be a brand new world! There's gotta be a second  chance out there for me! For everyone! 
 obj_shop4_762, \E6 So stay strong, little buddy. When I make it big, I'll  keep you in mind. 
 obj_shop4_767, \E3 Little buddy! There's a brand new world  out there waiting  for us. 
 obj_shop4_768, \E6 I'm sure with my ahem  qualifications, it won't  be long before I'm a  famous movie star... 
 obj_shop4_769, \E4 Or, maybe I'll just end up  flipping burgers again. 
 obj_shop4_770, \E3 But it's as I say! Nowhere to go but up! Literally, in this case! 
 obj_shop4_775, \E6 Sorry, little weirdo. Threats won't work on me. 
 obj_shop4_776,  I can't go to hell. I'm all out of vacation  days. 
 obj_shop4_785,  I'm sorry, Ha ha it's against  the rules to talk to customers  who haven't bought anything. 
 obj_shop4_790,  What? Why do you keep trying to talk  to me? 
 obj_shop4_792,  I'll get in trouble if I get  chummy with the customers. 
 obj_shop4_793,  Sorry. 
 obj_shop4_794, \E4 ... 
 obj_shop4_795, \E3 SO, I wanted to be an ACTOR.

 obj_storybattle_gen_1073, Howdy, \[C]! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1074, You finally madeit home. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1075, Remember when weused to play here? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1076, Hee hee hee... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1077, Boy! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1078, \E9Today's gonna bejust as fun. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1093, I remember when Ifirst woke up here,in the garden. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1094, I was so scared. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1095, I couldn't feel myarms or my legs... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1096, My entire body hadturned into aflower! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1097, \E5 + '' + Mom! Dad!Somebody help me! + '' + I called out. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1098, \E9But nobody came. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1107, Eventually, the kingfound me, crying inthe garden. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1108, I explained what hadhappened to him. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1109, Then he held me,\[C]. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1110, He held me withtears in his eyes,saying... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1111, '' + There, there.Everything is goingto be alright. + '' +  
 obj_storybattle_gen_1112, He was so...Emotional. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1113, But...For some reason... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1114, I didn't feelanything at all. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1123, I soon realized Ididn't feel ANYTHINGabout ANYONE. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1124, My compassion haddisappeared! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1125, \E7And believe me,it's not like Iwasn't trying. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1126, \E3I wasted weeks withthat stupid king,vainly hoping I wouldfeel something. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1127, But it became toomuch for me. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1128, I ran away fromhome. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1129, Eventually, I reachedthe RUINS. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1130, Inside I found HER,\[C]. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1131, I thought of allpeople, SHE couldmake me feel wholeagain. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1132, ... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1133, \E7She failed. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1134, \E6Ha ha... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1144, I realized those twowere useless. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1145, I became despondent. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1146, I just wanted tolove someone. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1147, I just wanted tocare about someone. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1148, \[C], you mightnot believe this... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1149, But I decided...It wasn't worthliving anymore. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1150, \E7Not in a worldwithout love. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1151, \E6Not in a worldwithout you. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1152, So... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1153, I decided to followin your footsteps. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1154, I would erase myselffrom existence. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1155, And you know what? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1156, I succeeded. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1165, But as I left thismortal coil... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1166, I started to feelapprehensive. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1167, \E9If you don't havea SOUL, what happenswhen you...? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1168, Something primalstarted to burninside me. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1169, '' + No, + '' +  I thought. + '' + I don't want todie! + '' +  
 obj_storybattle_gen_1170, ... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1171, Then I woke up. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1172, Like it was alljust a bad dream. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1173, I was back at thegarden. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1174, Back at my + '' + save point. + '' +  
 obj_storybattle_gen_1183, Interested, I decidedto experiment. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1184, Again and again, Ibrought myself tothe edge of death. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1185, At any point, Icould have let thisworld continue onwithout me. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1186, But as long as Iwas determined tolive... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1187, I could go back. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1188, \E6Amazing, isn't it,\[C]? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1189, I was amazed, too. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1197, At first, I used mypowers for good. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1198, I became  + '' + friends + '' + with everyone. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1199, I solved all theirproblems flawlessly. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1200, Their companionshipwas amusing... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1201, For a while.  
 obj_storybattle_gen_1202, As time repeated,people provedthemselvespredictable. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1203, What would thisperson say if Igave them this? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1204, What would they doif I said this tothem? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1205, Once you know theanswer, that's it. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1206, That's all they are. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1217, It all startedbecause I wascurious. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1218, Curious what wouldhappen if I killedthem. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1219,  + '' + I don't like this, + '' + I told myself. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1220,  + '' + I'm just doing thisbecause I HAVE toknow what happens. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1221, \E8Ha ha ha...What an excuse! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1222, \E9You of all peoplemust know howliberating it is toact this way. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1223, \E8At least we're betterthan those sickosthat stand around andWATCH it happen... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1224, \E9Those pathetic peoplethat want to see it,but are too weak todo it themselves. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1225, I bet someone likethat's watching rightnow, aren't they...? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1235, Nowadays, even that'sgrown tiring. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1236, \E7You understand,\[C]. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1237, \E6I've done everythingthis world has tooffer. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1238, I've read every book.I've burned everybook. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1239, I've won every game.I've lost every game. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1240, I've appeasedeveryone.I've killed everyone. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1241, Sets of numbers...Lines of dialogue...I've seen them all. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1242, But you...YOU'RE different. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1243, I never couldpredict YOU, \[C]. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1252, When I saw you inthe RUINS, I didn'trecognize you. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1253, \E8I thought I couldfrighten you, thensteal your SOUL. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1254, I failed. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1255, And when I triedto load my savefile... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1256, It didn't work. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1257, \E9\[C]...Your DETERMINATION! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1258, \E8Somehow, it's evengreater than mine! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1267, I just have onequestion for you,\[C]. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1268, How did you getback to the RUINSfrom here...? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1269, ... wait, I know. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1270, She must have takenyou when she left. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1271, And decided to giveyou a proper burial,rather than... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1272, Hanging out in thebasement forever. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1273, ... but, why then...? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1274, What made you wakeup? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1275, \E6Did you hear mecalling you...? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1286, It doesn't matternow. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1287, I'm so tired ofthis, \[C]. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1288, I'm tired of allthese people. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1289, I'm tired of allthese places. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1290, I'm tired of beinga flower. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1291, \[C]. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1292, There's just onething left I wantto do. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1293, Let's finish what westarted. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1294, Let's free everyone. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1295, \E8Then... let's letthem see whathumanity isREALLY like! 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1296, \E6That despite it all... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1297, \E9This world is still + '' + kill or be killed!! + '' +  
 obj_storybattle_gen_1307, Then...? 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1308, \E7Well.I had... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1309, \E9Been entertaining afew ways to usethat power. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1310, \E8Hee hee hee... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1311, ... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1312, But seeing you herechanged my mind. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1313, \E6\[C]...I think if you'rearound... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1314, \E7Just living in thesurface worlddoesn't seem so bad. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1324, We don't even needto leave to getthem this time. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1325, The king has six ofthem locked away. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1326, I've tried hundredsof ways to get himto show me them... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1327, \E3But he just won't. 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1328, \[C]... 
 obj_storybattle_gen_1329, I know he'll do itfor YOU.

 obj_torieltrigger9_82,  Now be a good child  and go upstairs. 
 obj_torinteractable7_82,  Do not worry about  me. 
 obj_torinteractable7_83,  Someone has to take  care of these flowers. 
 obj_torinteractable7_93,  Don't worry about  me. 
 obj_torinteractable7_94,  Someone has to take  care of these flowers. 
 obj_torinteractable7_99,  Frisk, please leave  me alone. 
 obj_torinteractable7_100, \E3 I can't come back. I just can't, OK? 
 obj_torinteractable7_106, \E7 I don't want to break  their hearts all over  again. 
 obj_torinteractable7_107,  It's better if they  never see me. 
 obj_torinteractable7_113, \E7 ... why are you still  here? 
 obj_torinteractable7_114,  Are you trying to keep  me company? 
 obj_torinteractable7_115,  Frisk... 
 obj_torinteractable7_116,  ... 
 obj_torinteractable7_117, \E7 Hey. 
 obj_torinteractable7_118,  Let me ask you a  question. 
 obj_torinteractable7_119,  Frisk... Why did you come  here? 
 obj_torinteractable7_120,  Everyone knows the  legend, right...? 
 obj_torinteractable7_121,   + '' + Travellers who climb  Mt. Ebott are said  to disappear. + '' +  
 obj_torinteractable7_122, \E7 ... 
 obj_torinteractable7_123,  Frisk. 
 obj_torinteractable7_124,  Why would you ever  climb a mountain  like that? 
 obj_torinteractable7_125, \E7 Was it foolishness? 
 obj_torinteractable7_126,  Was it fate? 
 obj_torinteractable7_127,  Or was it... Because you...? 
 obj_torinteractable7_128, \E7 Well. 
 obj_torinteractable7_129,  Only you know the  answer, don't you...? 
 obj_torinteractable7_135,  I know why \[C]  climbed the mountain. 
 obj_torinteractable7_136, \E7 It wasn't for a  very happy reason. 
 obj_torinteractable7_137,  Frisk. I'll be honest with  you. 
 obj_torinteractable7_138, \E7 \[C] hated humanity. 
 obj_torinteractable7_139,  Why they did, they  never talked about  it. 
 obj_torinteractable7_140,  But they felt very  strongly about  that. 
 obj_torinteractable7_146,  Frisk... You really ARE different  from \[C]. 
 obj_torinteractable7_147,  In fact, though you  have similar, uh,  fashion choices... 
 obj_torinteractable7_148,  I don't know why I  ever acted like you  were the same person. 
 obj_torinteractable7_149, \E7 Maybe... The truth is... 
 obj_torinteractable7_150,  \[C] wasn't really  the greatest person. 
 obj_torinteractable7_151, \E7 While, Frisk... 
 obj_torinteractable7_152,  You're the type of  friend I wish I  always had. 
 obj_torinteractable7_153, \E7 So maybe I was kind  of projecting a  little bit. 
 obj_torinteractable7_154,  Let's be honest. I did some weird  stuff as a flower. 
 obj_torinteractable7_160,  There's one last  thing I feel like  I should tell you. 
 obj_torinteractable7_161,  Frisk, when \[C]  and I combined our  SOULs together... 
 obj_torinteractable7_162,  The control over our  body was actually split  between us. 
 obj_torinteractable7_163,  They were the one  that picked up their  own empty body. 
 obj_torinteractable7_164,  And then, when we  got to the village... 
 obj_torinteractable7_165,  They were the one  that wanted to... 
 obj_torinteractable7_166,  ... to use our full  power. 
 obj_torinteractable7_167,  I was the one that  resisted. 
 obj_torinteractable7_168, \E7 And then, because of  me, we... 
 obj_torinteractable7_169,  Well, that's why I  ended up a flower. 
 obj_torinteractable7_170,  Frisk... 
 obj_torinteractable7_171,  This whole time, I've  blamed myself for  that decision. 
 obj_torinteractable7_172,  That's why I adopted  that horrible view  of the world. 
 obj_torinteractable7_173,   + '' + Kill or be killed. + '' +  
 obj_torinteractable7_174, \E7 But now... After meeting you... 
 obj_torinteractable7_175,  Frisk, I don't regret  that decision anymore. 
 obj_torinteractable7_176, \E4 I did the right  thing. 
 obj_torinteractable7_177,  If I killed those  humans... 
 obj_torinteractable7_178,  We would have had to  wage war against all  of humanity. 
 obj_torinteractable7_179,  And in the end,  everyone went free,  right? 
 obj_torinteractable7_180, \E7 I still feel kind  of sad knowing how  long it took... 
 obj_torinteractable7_181,  ... so maybe it  wasn't a perfect  decision. 
 obj_torinteractable7_182,  But you can't regret  hard choices your  whole life, right? 
 obj_torinteractable7_183, \E7 Well, not that I  have much of a life  left. 
 obj_torinteractable7_184,  But that's besides  the point. 
 obj_torinteractable7_190,  Frisk, thank you  for listening to me. 
 obj_torinteractable7_191,  You should really go  be with your friends  now, OK? 
 obj_torinteractable7_192,  Oh, and, please... 
 obj_torinteractable7_193, \E7 In the future, if you  uh, see me... 
 obj_torinteractable7_194,  Don't think of it as  me, OK? 
 obj_torinteractable7_195,  I just want you to  remember me like this. 
 obj_torinteractable7_196,  Someone that was your  friend for a little  while. 
 obj_torinteractable7_197,  Oh, and Frisk... 
 obj_torinteractable7_198,  Be careful in the  outside world, OK? 
 obj_torinteractable7_199,  Despite what everyone  thinks, it's not as  nice as it is here. 
 obj_torinteractable7_200, \E7 There are a lot of  Floweys out there. 
 obj_torinteractable7_201,  And not everything can  be resolved by just  being nice. 
 obj_torinteractable7_202,  Frisk... 
 obj_torinteractable7_203,  Don't kill, and  don't be killed,  alright? 
 obj_torinteractable7_204,  That's the best you  can strive for. 
 obj_torinteractable7_205,  Well, see you. 
 obj_torinteractable7_212, \E7 Frisk... 
 obj_torinteractable7_213, \E6 Don't you have  anything better to  do?

 obj_townnpc_bear1_70,  This town doesn't have a  mayor. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_71,  But if there's ever a problem,  a skeleton will tell a fish  lady about it. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_72,  Thaaaaaat's politics! 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_73,  Politics. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_77,  What if I ran for mayor...? 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_78,  I don't think I would do  a good job, and I hate  responsibility... 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_79,  But I love politics. So I might be a perfect  match. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_85,  I heard Dr. Alphys told  the king and queen the  awful things she'd done. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_86,  The king felt so bad  that he didn't know. He gave her a big hug. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_87,  Then the queen fired her. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_88,  Now we don't have a Royal  Scientist anymore... 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_89,  Thaaaaat's politics! 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_93,  Too bad there are no  politics on the surface. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_99,  Hmmm, usually that skeleton  goes to meet with Undyne  about now. 
 obj_townnpc_bear1_100,  Where is he...? I can feel our political  system crumbling apart... 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_70,  Awful teens tormented  a local monster by decorating  its tree-like horns. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_71,  So we started giving that  monster presents to make it  feel better. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_72,  Now it's a tradition to put  presents underneath a decorated  tree. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_74,  Guess it was a good thing  those teens tormented that  monster...? 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_78,  Hmm? Adjusting the presents is  my responsibility. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_79,  Nah, to be honest, I  just keep looking to see  if I've gotten one... 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_84,  It'll be nice to show humans  our presents-under-the-tree  tradition. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_85,  They'll probably be weirded  out by it. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_90,  You know what's cute? 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_91,  Those two married dogs  always put presents under  the tree for each other. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_92,  It's always the same. A single bone. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_93,  But every time, they act  like it's the first time  they've gotten it. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_94,  Then Papyrus comes to take  his bones back. 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_95,  Anyway, where are those  two...? 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_100,  That's strange. There was a present here  for Papyrus... 
 obj_townnpc_beartree_101,  Now it's gone. Did someone steal it? 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_70,  That lady over there... 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_71,  Something about her disturbs  me. 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_72,  I think I've figured it out. ... no, nevermind. 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_76,  That lady over there's  been going for a walk  for a while now. 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_77,  ... but she hasn't moved  an inch from where she's  standing. 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_78,  W-well, I haven't either,  but I don't want her to  notice me over here... 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_83,  Uhhh... 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_84,  Is anyone else weirded out  by those giant shambling  amalgamates, or...? 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_85,  ...... 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_90,  That lady over there  seems happy today. 
 obj_townnpc_bunboy_91,  Don't know why, but it's  sending shivers down my  spine... 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_70,  Isn't my little Cinnamon  just the cutest? 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_71,  Bun-buns are so adorable... Tee hee! 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_73,  Bun-bun-bun-bun-bun... 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_77,  Huh? Yes, I'm taking  my bunny for a walk. 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_78,  It's just a very slow one. 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_83,  That kid over there told  me that it's weird that  I have a pet bunny. 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_84,  First, there'd be nothing  weird about it. It's cute! 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_85,  Second... What? 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_86,  It's normal to walk your  younger brother on a  leash, right? 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_91,  Ah, it's so peaceful  and quiet... 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_92,  Usually one of those dogs  chases my little Cinnamon  around. 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_97,  Ah, it's so peaceful  and quiet... 
 obj_townnpc_bunlady_98,  Usually one of those  skeletons chases my little  Cinnamon around. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_70,  The capital's getting pretty  crowded, so I've heard they're  going to start moving here. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_71,  Hmmm... I don't want to see the  erasure of our local culture. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_72,  But I definitely want to see  some city slickers slip onto  their butts! 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_73,  Yeah, bring 'em on! 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_77,  What will happen to  Grillby's if everyone  moves in...? 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_78,  We're gonna have to have  chairs to the ceiling. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_83,  Hey! People won't have to  move in from the city  anymore! 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_84,  Seems like we won't have  to lose our local culture. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_85,  ... except we're all moving  out of here, huh. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_86,  Oh well. Guess it can't be  all punk-peaches and punk-  cream. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_91,  The capital's getting pretty  crowded, so I've heard they're  going to start moving here. 
 obj_townnpc_hatescity_92,  ... who knows. Maybe we'll have room. 
 obj_townnpc_icewolf_71,  Ice Wolf no longer has to  throw Ice. 
 obj_townnpc_icewolf_72,  Ice Wolf can take a break to  buy some pants now. 
 obj_townnpc_icewolf_74,  Ice Wolf thinking of changing  their name to Jimmy Hotpants. 
 obj_townnpc_innlady_114,  Error. 
 obj_townnpc_innlady_199,  Hiya! You look like you  had a great sleep. 
 obj_townnpc_innlady_200,  Which is incredible, because  you were only up there for  about two minutes... 
 obj_townnpc_innlady_203,  Here's your money back. You can pay me if you're  going to stay overnight. 
 obj_townnpc_innlady_207,  Feel free to come back  if you get tired. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_80,  Yo! You're a kid too, right? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_81,  I can tell 'cause you're  wearing a striped shirt. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_82,  I wonder if that weird skeleton  is an adult or a kid. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_88,  Yo... There you are! 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_89,  I've been kinda worried  about you since you  ran away. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_90,  ... but now I'm just kinda  mad, ha ha. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_91,  If Undyne hadn't saved me,  that woulda been bad... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_93,  ... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_97,  Yo... Uh... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_98,  Don't talk to me. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_100,  ... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_104,  Yo!!! What's up!? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_105,  I've been kinda, doing  some thinking... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_106,  Maybe Undyne... Isn't actually as cool as  we thought. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_107,  She's just kinda... mean. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_108,  But YO!!! I just found out about  someone WAYYY cooler!!! 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_109,  Nyeh heh heh!!! 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_111,  Nyeh heh heh, dude. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_117,  Yo, everyone ran away and  hid somewhere. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_118,  Man, adults can be so  dumb sometimes, haha... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_119,  Don't they know we've  got Undyne to protect us!? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_122,  Yo! Are you sneaking out to  see her, too? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_123,  Awesome... She's the coolest, right!? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_124,  I wanna be just like her  when I grow up... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_125,  Hey, don't tell my parents  I'm here. Ha ha. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_127,  OK, I'm ready when you  are. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_129,  Yo! Where were you going...? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_130,  My parents didn't tell you  to come here, did they? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_132,  You know where you're  going, right...? 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_133,  I was just gonna follow  you... Ha ha. 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_141,  Yo, this ledge is way  too steep... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_147,  Hmmm.... 
 obj_townnpc_monsterkid1_161,  Yo, you aren't going to  be able to climb with  an umbrella. 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_70,  We all know the underground  has problems, but we  smile anyway. 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_71,  Why? 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_72,  We can't do anything, so  why be morose about it? 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_73,  Smile smile. 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_83,  Maybe I'll try frowning  for once. 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_84,  ... no. I just can't do it. 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_89,  Oh? We're free? 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_90,  Finally... I'll be able to stop  smiling. 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_95,  Just now, I felt my smile  falter for a moment. 
 obj_townnpc_reddemon_96,  What's wrong? 
 obj_townnpc_slimedad_70,  Ah, to be young again. The world sure felt boundless. 
 obj_townnpc_slimedad_74,  You like to wander. You must be young. 
 obj_townnpc_slimedad_79,  Seems like this is the  beginning of a brand-new,  boundless world... 
 obj_townnpc_slimedad_80,  Wah-ha! This adventurous spirit! I'm like a kid again! 
 obj_townnpc_slimedad_81,  And my children are like... Double-children. 
 obj_townnpc_slimedad_86,  I've sent the kids inside. 
 obj_townnpc_slimedad_87,  It feels unsafe here today. 
 obj_townnpc_slimedaughter_80,  You aren't gonna make me  be the human again, are you? 
 obj_townnpc_slimedaughter_84,  Can we PLEASE play something  else...? 
 obj_townnpc_slimedaughter_89,  Hmmm... When humans play Monsters  and Humans... 
 obj_townnpc_slimedaughter_90,  Do they just call it  Humans and Humans? 
 obj_townnpc_slimeson_75,  Let's play Monsters and Humans! 
 obj_townnpc_slimeson_79,  Let's continue to play  Monsters and Humans! 
 obj_townnpc_slimeson_84,  Now we can play Monsters  and Humans with REAL humans! 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_70,  Everyone is always laughing  and cracking jokes, trying  to forget our modern crises... 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_71,  Dreariness. Crowding. Lack of sunlight. 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_72,  I would join them, but I'm  just not very funny. 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_73,  At least I'm not making puns. 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_77,  Wait! I've got a joke! 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_78,  Knock knock! 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_79,  ... Uh. That's all I've thought of. 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_85,  Looks like I don't have  to worry about cracking  jokes anymore. 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_86,  ... 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_87,  I was going to say a joke  here, but I really don't  have one. 
 obj_townnpc_unfunny_92,  It just feels like... Like everything is getting  worse and worse. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_72,  I  + '' + put out a line + '' +  for some  girls today. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_73,  Someone told me that there  are plenty of fish in the  sea... 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_74,  Well, I'm taking that  seriously. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_75,  I'm literally going to make  out with a fish. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_76,  I guess I could ask out Undyne. But I think she likes someone  already. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_80,  Did I catch anyone yet? I can't bear to look... 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_85,  Sans is the most regular  regular of all. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_86,  He hasn't been showing up  as much recently though. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_91,  Where the heck is Sans? 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_92,  He told me he had some  bait I could use. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_93,  Though it was probably  some kind of prank. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_94,  But I wanted to know what  the prank was! 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_99,  In the end, I never caught  any girls on my fishing  line. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_100,  So kid, take it from me... 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_101,  Don't try to catch hot  people with a fishing rod. 
 obj_townnpc_weirdfish_102,  Somewhere, you hear a whinny  of dismay.

 obj_undyneboss_705, \E7... 
 obj_undyneboss_1085,  The wind is howling... 
 obj_undyneboss_1086,  Undyne flips her spear  impatiently. 
 obj_undyneboss_1087,  Flower pollen drifts in  front of you. 
 obj_undyneboss_1088,  Water rushes around you. 
 obj_undyneboss_1089,  The spears pause for a  moment. 
 obj_undyneboss_1094,  Undyne points heroically  towards the sky. 
 obj_undyneboss_1095,  Undyne flips her spear  impatiently. 
 obj_undyneboss_1096,  Undyne suplexes a huge  boulder, just because  she can. 
 obj_undyneboss_1097,  Undyne bounces impatiently. 
 obj_undyneboss_1098,  Undyne flashes a menacing  smile. 
 obj_undyneboss_1099,  Undyne draws her finger  across her neck. 
 obj_undyneboss_1100,  Undyne holds her fist in  front of her and shakes  her head. 
 obj_undyneboss_1101,  Undyne towers threateningly. 
 obj_undyneboss_1102,  Undyne thinks of her friends  and pounds the ground  with her fists. 
 obj_undyneboss_1103,  Smells like sushi. 
 obj_undyneboss_1107,  Undyne's eye is twitching  involuntarily. 
 obj_undyneboss_1108,  Undyne is smashing spears  on the ground. 
 obj_undyneboss_1109,  Undyne's eyes dart around  to see if this is  a prank. 
 obj_undyneboss_1110,  Undyne is hyperventilating. 
 obj_undyneboss_1111,  Smells like angry fish. 
 obj_undyneboss_1118,  Undyne is smiling as if  nothing is wrong. 
 obj_undyneboss_1119,  Undyne's body is wavering. 
 obj_undyneboss_1120,  Undyne's body is losing  its shape. 
 obj_undyneboss_1121,  Undyne's body... 
 obj_undyneboss_1122,  ... 
 obj_undyneboss_1145,  UNDYNE - ATK 50 DEF 20 The heroine that NEVER gives  up.^ 
 obj_undyneboss_1168,  You tell UNDYNE her attacks  are too easy. She doesn't care.^ 
 obj_undyneboss_1174,  You tell UNDYNE her attacks  are too easy. The bullets get faster.^ 
 obj_undyneboss_1176,  You tell UNDYNE her attacks  are too easy. The bullets get unfair.^

 obj_undyneboss_1195,  Hamburger Helpers.^ 
 obj_undyneboss_1205,  You told Undyne you didn't  want to fight. But nothing happened.^

 obj_undyneboss_1210,  Her attacks became a little  less extreme.^

 obj_undynedate_afterward_119,  OH! And if you ever  need help...

 obj_undynedate_afterward_152,  Papyrus suggested  that I ask you. 
 obj_undynedate_afterward_153, \E3 But he told me when  I still hated you,  so... 
 obj_undynedate_afterward_154,  Uh! Anyway!!! Here! Just take it!

 obj_undynedate_inside_339, \E3SHE'S JUST NOTUP TO THECHALLENGE. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_351,  CHALLENGE!? What!? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_352,  Papyrus! Wait a second...! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_367,  Darnit! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_368,  He thinks I can't  be friends with  YOU!? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_369, \E6 Fuhuhu! What a joke! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_370,  I could make friends  with a wimpy loser  like you any day! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_371,  I'll show him! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_372, \E3 Listen up, human. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_373,  We're not just  going to be  friends. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_374, \E3 We're going to  be... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_375, \M1 BESTIES. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_376,  I'll make you  like me so much... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_377,  You won't be able  to think of anyone  else!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_378, \E3 Fuhuhuhu! It's the PERFECT  REVENGE!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_379,  ... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_380, \E9 Why don't you  have a seat? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_415,  Oh, leaving so soon? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_416, \E3 No. No you're not. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_471,  Comfortable? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_472,  I'll get you  something to drink. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_561,  All set! What would you like? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_604,  HEY!!! DON'T GET UP!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_605,  YOU'RE THE GUEST!! SIT DOWN AND ENJOY  YOURSELF!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_606,  ... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_614, \E9 Um, why not just  point to what you  want? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_615,  You can use the  spear! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_643, \E4 Y'know, I was a  pretty hotheaded  kid. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_644,  Once, to prove I was  the strongest, I tried  to fight ASGORE. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_645,  Emphasis on TRIED. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_646,  I couldn't land  a single blow  on him! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_647, \E4 And worse, the whole  time, he refused  to fight back! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_648, \E7 I was so  humiliated... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_649,  Afterwards, he  apologized and said  something goofy... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_650,   + '' + Excuse me, do you  want to know how  to beat me? + '' +  
 obj_undynedate_inside_651,  I said yes, and  from then on, he  trained me. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_652, \E4 One day, during  practice, I finally  knocked him down. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_653, \E7 I felt... bad. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_654, \E9 But he was  beaming... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_655, \E6 I had never seen  someone more proud to  get their butt kicked. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_656,  ... oh! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_657, \E9 I almost forgot  about your tea! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_658,  Just a moment! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_696,  Wait a second. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_697,  Papyrus... His cooking lesson... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_698, \M2 HE WAS SUPPOSED  TO HAVE THAT RIGHT  NOW!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_699, \E3 And if HE's not  here to have it... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_700,  YOU'LL HAVE TO  HAVE IT FOR HIM!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_833,  That's right!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_834,  NOTHING has brought  Papyrus and I  closer than cooking! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_835, \E3 Which means that if  I give you his  lesson... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_836,  WE'LL BECOME CLOSER  THAN YOU CAN  EVER IMAGINE!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_837, \E6 Fuhuhu!!! Afraid!? We're gonna be best  friends!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1000,  Ready!? It's spaghetti time! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1001,  Let's start with the  sauce!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1128,  Uhh, we'll just scrape  this into a bowl  later. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1129,  But for NOW! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1235,  Alright! Now it's time  to stir the pasta! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1236,  As a general rule  of thumb, the more  you stir... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1237,  THE BETTER IT IS! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1238,  Ready? Let's do it! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1326, \M0 Fuhuhuhu! That's the stuff! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1328,  Alright, now for  the final step: 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1329,  TURN UP THE HEAT! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1330,  Let the stovetop  symbolize your  passion! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1331,  Let your hopes and  dreams turn into  burning fire! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1332,  READY? Don't hold anything  back!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1444,  Ah. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1445,  Man, no wonder  Papyrus sucks at  cooking. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1465,  So what's next? Scrapbooking? Friendship bracelets? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1466,  ... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1475,  ... oh, who am I  kidding. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1476,  I really screwed this  up, didn't I? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1477, \E4 I can't force you to  like me, human. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1478, \E4 Some people just  don't get along  with each other. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1479, \E7 I understand if  you feel that  way about me. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1480, \E4 And if we can't  be friends... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1481, \E7 That's okay. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1482, \E7 Because... If we're not  friends... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1490, \M2 IT MEANS I CAN  DESTROY YOU WITHOUT  REGRET! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1641,  It'll take a moment  for the water to  boil. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1671,  Okay, it's all  done! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1771,  Here we are. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1833,  Careful, it's hot. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1850,  It's not THAT hot!! Just drink it already! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1851, \TS \F0 \T0  
 obj_undynedate_inside_1852,  You take a sip of the  tea. It's burning... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1853,  But other than that,  it's pretty good. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1855,  It's pretty good,  right? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1856, \E6 Nothing but the best  for my ABSOLUTELY  PRECIOUS FRIEND!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1873, \E9 Hey... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1874, \E9 You know... It's kind of strange  you chose THAT tea. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1875, \E4 Golden flower tea... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1876,  That's ASGORE's  favorite kind. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1877, \E4 Actually, now that  I think about it... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1878, \E9 You kind of remind  me of him. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1879, \E6 You're both TOTAL  weenies!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1880, \E7 ... sort of. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1898, \E4 Y'know, I was a  pretty hotheaded  kid. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1899,  Once, to prove I was  the strongest, I tried  to fight ASGORE. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1900,  Emphasis on TRIED. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1901,  I couldn't land  a single blow  on him! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1902, \E4 And worse, the whole  time, he refused  to fight back! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1903, \E7 I was so  humiliated... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1904,  Afterwards, he  apologized and said  something goofy... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1905,   + '' + Excuse me, do you  want to know how  to beat me? + '' +  
 obj_undynedate_inside_1906,  I said yes, and  from then on, he  trained me. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1907, \E4 One day, during  practice, I finally  knocked him down. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1908, \E7 I felt... bad. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1909, \E9 But he was  beaming... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1910, \E6 I had never seen  someone more proud to  get their butt kicked. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1911, \E4 Anyway, long story  short, he kept training  me... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1912,  And now I'm the  head of the Royal  Guard! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1913, \E6 So I'm the one  who gets to train  dorks to fight! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1914, \E9 ... like, uh, Papyrus. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1935, \E4 But, um, to be  honest... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1936, \E9... I don't know if... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1937, \E7 I can ever let  Papyrus into the  Royal Guard. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1938,  Don't tell him I  said that! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1939, \E4 He's just... Well... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1940, \E9 I mean, it's not  that he's weak. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1941,  He's actually  pretty freaking  tough! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1942, \E7 It's just that... He's... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1943,  He's too innocent  and nice!!! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1944, \E7 I mean, look, he  was SUPPOSED to  capture you... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1945, \E5 And he ended up  being FRIENDS with  you instead! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1946,  I could NEVER send  him into battle! 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1947, \E7 He'd get ripped  into little smiling  shreds. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1948, \E7 That's part of why... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1949, \E9 I started teaching  him how to cook,  you know? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1950, \E7 So, um, maybe he  can do something  else with his life. 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1978,  Oh, sorry, I was  talking for so  long... 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1979, \E9 You're out of tea,  aren't you? 
 obj_undynedate_inside_1980,  I'll get you some  more. 
 obj_undynedate_outside_155, PSST.

 obj_undynedate_outside_173, SHE LOVES THESE!

 obj_undynedate_outside_282,  Why don't. You two. Come in? 
 obj_undynedate_outside_364,  You hear someone shouting  a whisper at you from  inside the house. 
 obj_undynedate_outside_366, NO!YOU CAN'T ESCAPEFRIENDSHIP!! 
 obj_undyneencounter2_329,  Yo... did you see that!? 
 obj_undyneencounter2_330,  Undyne just...

 obj_undyneencounter2_332,  I'm never washing my face  ever again...! 
 obj_undyneencounter2_333,  Man, are you unlucky. 
 obj_undyneencounter2_334,  If you were standing just  a LITTLE bit to the left...! 
 obj_undyneencounter2_335,  Yo, don't worry! I'm sure we'll see her  again! 
 obj_undyneencounter2_338,  ... yo, did you notice? She seemed really mad  about something! 
 obj_undyneencounter2_339,  She looked liked she was  gonna blast me to pieces! 
 obj_undyneencounter2_340,  But... sigh... Then she decided to put  me down... 
 obj_undyneencounter2_341,  Yo! There's always next time,  right? Let's go! 
 obj_undyneencounter4_255, It sounds like itcame from overhere... 
 obj_undyneencounter4_256, Oh! You've fallendown, haven't you...

 obj_undyneencounter4_261, That's a nice name. 
 obj_undyneencounter4_275,  My name is      
 obj_undynefall_99,  Someone has meticulously  cleaned all the slime off of  this snail. 
 obj_undynetrash_69,  The trashcan is full  of broken spears. 
 obj_undynetrash_72,  The trashcan is empty. 
 obj_undynetrash_76,  You found a trashcan. 
 obj_undynetrash_77,  Inside the trashcan  was a key, barely visible  to the naked eye... 
 obj_undynetrash_78,  You take it. 
 obj_undynetrash_87,  A garbage can. But it's pretty cute.

 scr_papcall_1539, \E9 So I asked her  where she thought  the abyss led to! 
 scr_papcall_1540,  She looked up at  me, shocked, and went  red in the face. 
 scr_papcall_1541, \E6 But I'm scary,  so I'm used to  that kinda stuff! 
 scr_papcall_1542,  Then she kept  explaining all her  different theories.

 scr_torcall_113,  Papyrus made a bet with her  that she could not lift  everyone here up. 
 scr_torcall_114,  She could. 
 scr_torcall_115,  The only trouble is that  she did not know how to  put everyone down. 
 scr_torcall_120,  TORIEL sent you a message. Dear Frisk, 
 scr_torcall_121,  Alphys is telling me many  interesting facts about  the human world. 
 scr_torcall_122,  Quite a few of them are  wrong, though. 
 scr_torcall_123,  Frisk, you did not tell  her anything funny, did you? ]:  
 scr_torcall_128,  TORIEL sent you a message. Dear Frisk, 
 scr_torcall_129,  I heard that using the  computer for too long  is bad for you. 
 scr_torcall_130,  However, I have not seen  you use the computer at all. 
 scr_torcall_129_console,  I heard that playing  video games for too long  is bad for you. 
 scr_torcall_130_console,  However, I have not seen  you playing video games  at all. 
 scr_torcall_131,  You must be very healthy! How nice. 
 scr_torcall_136,  TORIEL sent you a message. Dear Frisk, 
 scr_torcall_137,  I think I may have to turn  off the phone for now. 
 scr_torcall_138,  Your friends are all very  lovely people! 
 scr_torcall_139,  I think I will spend this  time getting to know  them better. 
 scr_torcall_140,  Be good, alright? 
 scr_torcall_141,  Sincerely, Toriel.
